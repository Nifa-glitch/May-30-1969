This special issue is, ultimately, a love letter to librarians. Seven years into our archipelagos project, we pay tribute to those whose mandate has been to create possibilities for knowledge production --- to build and render imminently accessible a historical record that serves the needs of researchers and educators working in the present. 
this issue is meant to make these phenomena explicit --- to take a sweeping look at the "back-end" ...

how in putting together this special issue Perry and Hadassa have modeled the very "best practices" discussed by the various essays. the diversity of contributors --- seniority, professional role, institutional affiliation, national origin, etc

navigating multiple players, multiple relationships, both within and beyond the academy; well aware of the breadth of audiences that are served by open access digital collections; putting these different entities into conversation in ways that are adamantly decolonial, committed to social justice, reflective of shared values across borders of nation and language --- de facto modeling the role of our community's most dedicated and ethical librarians
