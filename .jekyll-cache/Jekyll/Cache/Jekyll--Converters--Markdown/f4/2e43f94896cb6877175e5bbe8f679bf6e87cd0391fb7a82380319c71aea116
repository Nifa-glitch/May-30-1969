I"’<p>Sarah Juliet Lauro is an assistant professor of hemispheric literature at the University of Tampa. She is the author of many works that address the figure of the living-dead zombie, including the book <em>The Transatlantic Zombie: Slavery, Rebellion, and Living Death</em> (Rutgers University Press, 2015), and is the editor of the forthcoming collection <em>Zombie Theory: A Reader</em> (University of Minnesota Press, 2017). Her next book project turns from zombies as a figuration of slavery and slave revolt, which is her central interest in the monster, to literal commemorations of slave rebellion in literature, art, film, and digital culture.</p>
