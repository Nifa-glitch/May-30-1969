<p>The <em><a href="https://ecda.northeastern.edu/">Early Caribbean Digital Archive</a></em>
is a compelling platform that engages with the pitfalls and
possibilities of uncovering alternative narratives within the
constrained space of the colonial historical record. Clearly
structured and aesthetically appealing, the site explicitly and
implicitly raises and grapples with crucial questions regarding
methodology and scholarly responsibility.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important question the <em>Early Caribbean Digital
Archive</em> brings to the fore is whether—or to what extent—it is in fact
possible to “decolonize the colonial archive” via digital practices of
“remixing.” The site authors acknowledge at the outset that the
materials they feature “are primarily authored and published by
Europeans,” but they quickly promise to push against that coloniality by
foregrounding the narratives and experiences of nonwhite peoples in the
early Americas.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The project’s stated goals are to go beyond
digitization and cataloging to provide both understanding of the
mechanisms of coloniality and opportunities for users to revise the
archive so to tell different, lesser-known stories.</p>

<p>Before getting to the matter of whether the site accomplishes these
objectives, it would be of interest for the site authors to reflect on a
number of grounding methodological questions, perhaps within the context
of the site’s “<a href="https://ecda.northeastern.edu/home/about/">About</a>”
section. Notably, how do we think about those sources we know are
curated (selected, abridged, otherwise manipulated) by those in
power—sources whose very presence in the archive reflects choices made
by colonial subjects? Even more provocatively, what precisely is
“decolonizing” and (why) do we want to “decolonize the archive”—might
not our goal be instead to replace the archive with anticolonial and
antislavery methods? Why, also, as per Marisa Fuentes’s citation on the
site’s landing page, should the goal of such projects be to present an
“unbiased account?” Why should “coherency” be the goal? Might not the
goal of history be to acknowledge our biases—or even to have “the right”
biases (it might be argued, even, that the attempt to be neutral is to
operate from the position of the colonizer—or what Mary Louise Pratt has
called the “monarch-of-all-I-survey” position)?<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Such broad questions
are worth posing.</p>

<p>Also important, if “troubling” to consider, is the matter of how
to determine whether the “embedded narratives” might in fact have been
mere literary devices. In other words, given that the invented
interlocutor is a major trope of the Enlightenment, can we accept at
face value the idea that these enslaved narrators were real and not
characters invented to illustrate something the colonial author wanted
to prove? Foregrounding such opacities would do the work of responsibly
framing the project—acknowledging not just its potentialities and
affordances but also its constraints and open queries.</p>

<p>Given their compelling claim that digitization makes a difference, it
would be of great value for the site authors to do the work of
extraction for a greater number of the embedded slave narratives
discoverable among the documents included in their archive.
Clearly/prominently identifying/naming enslaved narrators as the
defining offering of the platform would go a long way to doing the work
of “decolonizing.” Indeed, this is an extremely intriguing and very
promising dimension of the site’s contributions.</p>

<p>The “About” section under the “Archive” tab might more accurately be
labeled “Using the ECDA” or “Suggestion for Use,” or something along
those lines.</p>

<p>The “Classroom” tab is fantastic. How, though, do the site authors
determine whether materials uploaded via the “Submit Materials” button
at the bottom of the page ultimately end up on the site? Are these
materials vetted by a committee and, if so, what kinds of criteria are
used? Clarity around these questions would be useful to include on the
site.</p>

<p>On the whole, <em>The Early Caribbean Digital Archive</em> offers a useful and
wide-ranging portal into significant materials from the plantation
Americas and, as important, proposes compelling paths for querying and
pushing against the constraints of the colonial record.</p>

<p>Nicole Aljoe <em>and</em> Elizabeth Maddock Dillon</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ecda.northeastern.edu/"><em>Early Caribbean Digital Archive</em></a>
is a collaborative platform that aims to engage its users in thinking
about the coloniality of the archive of the early Caribbean and
possibilities for decolonizing this archive. It is an archive that
foregrounds the constructed nature of any archive and that—we
hope—encourages user engagement in the process of knowledge curating and
knowledge making, including revision and expansion of the materials on
our site. In this respect, it remains a work-in-progress. For that
reason, we are particularly grateful for the thoughtful review of the
<em>ECDA</em> provided by <em>sx archipelagos</em>.</p>

<p>Above all, the <em>ECDA</em> aims to use the digital nature of our archive to
challenge existing modes of using and creating archives of colonialism.
One of the key tenets that we have arrived at, as a team, is a
commitment to a notion of the archive as a changing and changeable
object—a notion of the archive as more <em>event</em> than object, as more an
<em>encounter</em> than a knowledge base. And for that reason the biggest
challenge (and excitement) of designing and developing the <em>ECDA</em> has
been trying to use the affordances of a digital platform to shift how
makers and users of archives might get their hands into the archive. How
do we make it possible for users (and not just makers) to “stir the
archive” and thus to perturb the knowledge structures that have made the
enslaved and indigenous people of the early Caribbean so invisible and
inaccessible to our existing accounts of history?<sup id="fnref:resp1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:resp1" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>We are pleased that the review of the <em>ECDA</em> notes two areas of success
in this effort: our collection of embedded slave narratives and our
classroom materials. By extracting embedded narratives of enslaved
people from the texts of European colonial writers and placing them in
the archive as discrete items with their own metadata, we aim to “remix”
the archive and give pride of authorial place to new voices, as well as
to challenge some of the metadata structures that have been used to
shore up the coloniality of knowledge and power. The pages under the
“Classroom” tab, which include guidelines about how one might use the
embedded slave narratives in a class, work in tandem with the embedded
slave narrative collection to invite people to explore what might be
learned (or lost) from such processes of remix. In newer materials on
the classroom pages, we also include sample assignments (and
documentation) that invite students and users to identify additional
embedded slave narratives for inclusion in the <em>ECDA</em> collection. We
could not agree more with the review that our current collection is
slim—indeed, it only begins to scratch the surface of what is possible.
But in pioneering a method for building such a collection, we hope that
we have opened the door for both our team and users of the archive to
continue to expand the collection in exciting new directions.</p>

<p>As we write this, the <em>ECDA</em> team of graduate students and faculty is
preparing a series of workshops in collaboration with the National
Archive of Barbados and the University of West Indies, Cave Hill.<sup id="fnref:resp2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:resp2" class="footnote">4</a></sup> At
these workshops, we will work with our partners in Barbados to invite
university students, heritage professionals, and members of the public
to transcribe runaway-slave advertisements from the recently digitized
<em>Barbados Mercury</em> and to begin conducting further research into the
narratives of the enslaved people whose lives are glimpsed—fugitively—in
these ads. We are not entirely sure what will come of these workshops in
terms of materials on our site. We do expect to add a section on
runaway-slave ads to our collection of embedded slave narratives, but we
also expect that collaborating with partners in Barbados may lead us in
new directions that we have not yet considered. The collaboration may
change the way we have been thinking about knowledge structures,
histories, narratives, metadata, digital representation, digital access,
and digital infrastructure; we are prepared and excited for that
possibility.</p>

<p>The review of the site usefully points out places of incompletion (such
as a “Representing Slavery” link—we are working on it, we promise) and
places where greater clarity could be offered to users. We have already
made some of the changes suggested. But we are also committed to a few
choices that the review questions. Overall, we see the <em>ECDA</em> as a site
of engagement rather than as an argument on the order of an academic
essay. For that reason, we include less language than our reviewers
might wish to explicate our methodological engagement with the
coloniality of the archive. We foreground citations of a number of
important scholars/writers on our splash page because these quotes are
incisive and provocative—they speak to the heart of the issue of
colonial archive and do so in a way that invites thought rather than
imparts “knowledge.” (Marisa Fuentes’s reference, in one such quotation,
to the desirability of an “unbiased account” of history is one that she
describes as a “disciplinary demand”—and thus one that she herself
questions, as do we.)</p>

<p>An additional question raised in the review about whether embedded slave
narratives are “mere literary devices” is an important one. Are the
“voices” of enslaved people in these embedded narratives so heavily
mediated that they cannot count as the voices of the enslaved? This is a
question that we hope users of the site and the collection of embedded
slave narratives will consider. We also hope that users of the site will
be able to discern the deeply mediated nature of all the texts and
images collected in the archive: for example, the voice of Bryan
Edwards—redacted through his editor, publisher, and readers—is also
mediated and shaped as a literary device, much as <a href="https://ecda.northeastern.edu/item/neu:m0415083s/">Clara’s
voice</a> is within his
text.<sup id="fnref:resp3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:resp3" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Our scholarly introductions to items in the archive foreground
the production, circulation, and reception histories of each item in
order to make these multiple levels of mediation more evident and
available to users of the archive.</p>

<p>The review also suggests that we organize the entirety of the site
around the collection of embedded slave narratives. We like that
idea—except, we have more modes of digital remix on deck. We are
working, for instance, on exhibits or clusters of “text networks”
(including one on the Haitian Maroon and “lord of poison” Makandal) that
map constellations of related texts across different genres and
languages—from, for instance, trial transcript, to newspaper, to short
story, to poem, to novel. We also have users who are designing exhibits
around archival materials that they have uncovered. In short, we are
working to offer a platform for collaborative engagement, and we expect
more experimental models of remixing the archive to appear as we
continue to work with new collaborators and explore new possibilities of
digital curation and knowledge creation.</p>
