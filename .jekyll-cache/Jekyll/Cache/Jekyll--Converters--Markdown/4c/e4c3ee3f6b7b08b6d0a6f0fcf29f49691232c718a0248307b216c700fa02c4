I"M<p>This essay argues that C. L. R. James’s Marxist humanism is inherently inadequate for describing the distinction and transition between slavery and capitalism. To do so, the essay interrogates James’s famous claim in <em>The</em> <em>Black Jacobins</em> (1938) that the slaves of St. Domingue were “closer to a modern proletariat than any group of workers in existence at the time,” by comparing James’s understanding of the concept of <em>proletariat</em>—there and in <em>World Revolution</em> (1937)—with Marx’s various developments of the concept across the three volumes of <em>Capital</em>. This analysis distinguishes James’s political and historicist deployment of the term from Marx’s analytical usage of the notion in his categorial critique of capitalism. In contrast with James’s linear, Marxist-humanist understanding of the passage from slavery to capitalism, Marx himself demarcates a well-defined delineation between these two basic categories, understood in <em>Capital</em> as analytically (as opposed to historically) distinct modes of production. The essay thus concludes by analyzing Marx’s conceptual differentiation of slavery and industrial capitalism in <em>Capital</em>, drawing on Etienne Balibar’s analysis of the concepts of mode of production and transition in <em>Reading Capital</em> (1965).</p>
