I"6<p>The ethos of the Small Axe Project, I’ve said, consists of a reflexive
attitude of listening to, and engaging with, the challenges and
provocations that grow out of the changing problem-spaces within which
we contingently find ourselves as Caribbean intellectuals, and as
scholars of the Caribbean. The ethos of the Small Axe Project,
therefore, is essentially an ethos of learning, and of learning how to
better learn—even to better learn what we think we already know. After
all, the Caribbean won’t stand still; and so the questions that
constitute the Caribbean as an interpretive domain don’t remain the
same. Consequently, we in the Small Axe Project are constantly being
called upon (and calling upon each other) to think, and to think again,
about the forms and platforms that should best shape and drive our
responsive hermeneutic endeavors.</p>

<p>In recent years the humanities and social sciences have been provoked to
consider the implications of the “digital turn” for scholarly production
and reception. The rise of new digital technologies, new modes of
accessing and organizing intellectual resources, new ways of connecting
and sharing various dimensions of understanding (and therefore of
integrating our cognitive and affective capacities of appreciation and
critical analysis), new questions about what should count as excellence
in scholarship, has opened up new possibilities and new challenges for
intellectual and artistic work. The Caribbean, we believe, in its
persistent historicity and conscripted modernity, is a geopolitical zone
that especially lends itself to the kinds of experiment and exploration
that the digital turn obliges us to confront. <em>sx archipelagos</em> is our
response to this momentous conjuncture.</p>
