I"9E<p><a href="https://colonyincrisis.lib.umd.edu/"><em>A Colony in Crisis</em></a> is a digital
exhibition that addresses a colonial flashpoint, the moment when failed
grain harvests in France fueled escalating political tensions between
white planters in Saint-Domingue and political elites in the
metropole.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The site’s authors, Abby Broughton, Kelsey
Corlett-Rivera, and Nathan Dize, in consultation with an
interdisciplinary team of experts, aim to present the relationship
between France and Saint-Domingue in a more dialogic fashion than is
traditionally depicted in French accounts. They highlight the
fundamental conflicts between the financial interests of planters and
the trade monopolies of the metropole, revealing positions that amount
to discourses of permanent complaint.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The site’s authors refer to a “potential famine” and call the grain
“much needed,” echoing the language of the 1780s planter supplicants who
spoke of a “<em>fear</em> of a food shortage.”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> However, it is important to
note that despite a production shortage in France, there was no grain
crisis in the colony of Saint-Domingue. Any potential shortfall
threatened exclusively the consumption of a small planter minority, and,
in fact, the colony’s intendant denied any threat to planter diets at
all.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Of all the colony-side missives gathered in <em>Colony in Crisis</em>,
only two address the question of food supplies for the enslaved,
although a helpful linked article suggests that other petitions often
did so, albeit in a nakedly utilitarian manner.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> These colony-side
writers admit that the enslaved were not receiving these grain
foodstuffs and suggest, in the course of their broader arguments, a
meager allotment well out of proportion with their population.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
Pamphleteers based in France also take only a passing stab at addressing
slave provisions. A single pamphlet offers (imprecise) estimates of the
number of enslaved people working on coffee plantations, arguing
(speciously) that food production there adequately supplied individuals
enslaved on sugar plantations (a number they in turn minimized). The
pamphleteers’ vague numeracy serves only to mislead, and most of the
elite writers whose letters are reproduced in <em>Colony in Crisis</em> avoid
specifics altogether, not out of yet another instance of willful elision
but because enslaved men, women, and children were not consuming these
grains.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In sum, the crisis was not about Saint-Domingue’s foodstuffs in any
substantive way, even if the corruption, hoarding, and monopolies of
high-level merchants and the intendant might have made local planters
feel frustrated and even temporarily food-insecure for their own
households. Instead, planters used France’s grain crisis as a flashpoint
to try to break the metropole’s economic monopoly and engage in regional
trade. The planters wanted not only to seek nearby supplies but also,
crucially, to benefit from an expanded market for Saint-Domingue’s cash
crops. Free ports, opened through the guise of supply trade, would have
unleashed Dominguan coffee and sugar to eager nearby markets,
particularly the United States, and free ports would furthermore easily
have concealed trade in many other products. American flour offered a
Trojan vessel for reduced oversight. Deregulation would have had
widespread effects, including diminished importance of France, as the
pamphleteers acknowledged.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The two elite groups speak past each
other, highlighting intransigent differences over high-level policy.
Authors in France invoke interimperial rivalry with Britain, even as
colonial planters are far more concerned with engagement to their
immediate north, with the United States.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Both elite groups were
frustrated with each other, and the point-counterpoint structure of
<em>Colony in Crisis</em> helps users understand the intransigence of each
position, even a few months after revolutionary fighting began on French
soil.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Several documents selected for issue 2.0 of <em>Colony in Crisis</em> seek “to
provide a larger, transnational context for . . . 1789
Saint-Domingue,”<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> and they succeed in highlighting promising new
avenues of expansion for the site’s collection. Two pamphlets in
particular offer a regional view of French administrative questions in
the Caribbean, pointing to new directions of inquiry: the functioning
and life of regional ports, regional foodways, and intra-Caribbean
traffic, more generally.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The scholars aver that their initial goal
for <em>Colony in Crisis</em> was to “speak to the conditions of the slaves,
wealthy and poor planters, free people of color, and the reactions to
the system of slavery in mainland France” and that this goal was
unmanageably broad.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> In these transcolonial documents, however, the
authors provide a scaffold for just such a growing dialogue.</p>

<p>University of Maryland pamphlets figure prominently in the first two
issues of <em>Colony in Crisis</em>, and these documents have been curated,
translated, and contextualized for a wide audience of academics,
students, and the general public.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> An annotated table of contents
(found under the tab for translations) offers helpful orientation, and
each entry benefits from a longer introduction on its own page, where
the French document is linked in its entirety from <a href="https://archive.org/index.php">Internet
Archive</a>, and the authors offer a
five-hundred- to seven-hundred-word English translation. The site is
eminently accessible for and welcoming to new users and is also well
designed, with built-in link redundancies for excellent navigation
between documents, explanations, and the rest of the project.</p>

<p><em>Colony in Crisis</em> calls attention to a wealth of printed resources
currently housed in separate physical institutions, and it succeeds
brilliantly in making them accessible to scholars of varying interests
and levels of engagement. One can easily see how another pamphlet series
might, for example, include
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ideadelvalordel00valvgoog">texts</a> from
Saint-Domingue’s immediate cattle-trading neighbor, Santo Domingo.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>
Another challenge might be how resources from this “rich print culture”
could be gathered alongside other more fragmentary text sources, oral
histories, and sound studies.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Or the impressive board of advisors
for <em>Colony in Crisis</em> could bring context to a wide variety of sources
and could also bring to new audiences the ongoing vibrant debates about
the <a href="http://socialtext.dukejournals.org/content/33/4_125.toc">archive</a>
itself.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> These discussions would inevitably more thoroughly engage
the lived experience of the enslaved men, women, and children who made
up the majority of Saint-Domingue as the colony confronted various
crises in the 1780s. That said, even at this present stage of the
project’s development, readers will certainly have a sense of the
magnitude and value of the site, and I look forward to following the
project as it grows.</p>
