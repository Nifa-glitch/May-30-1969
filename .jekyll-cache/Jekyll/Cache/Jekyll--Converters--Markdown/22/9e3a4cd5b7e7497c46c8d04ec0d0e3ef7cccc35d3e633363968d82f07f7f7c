I"@<p>New media technologies—from the tape recorder to the computer—enabled Kamau Brathwaite’s revolutionary poetic approach; digital technologies likewise enable us to study and teach his groundbreaking work in new ways. This essay argues that teaching and studying Brathwaite should begin with the audible word not the written text and that digital audio archives and platforms can play a key role in enabling this approach. Digital audio archives such as PennSound and the Poetry Archive allow students and scholars to approach Brathwaite’s work by listening closely to a wide range of sound recordings. This essay demonstrates the utility of this close listening approach by taking advantage of the digital platform of <em>archipelagos journal</em> to interweave its text with Brathwaite’s recorded voice. It not only demonstrates the value of approaching Brathwaite’s work through digital sound recordings but also argues for a larger overturning of critical, pedagogical, and essayistic conventions in literary studies through a methodological turn away from the page.</p>
