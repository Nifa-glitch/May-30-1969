I"Í*<p><a href="https://puertoricosyllabus.com/"><em>Puerto Rico Syllabus</em></a> is the website
for a public syllabus project led by Yarimar Bonilla, Marisol Lebr√≥n,
and Sarah Molinari, stemming from the work of the Unpayable Debt working
group at Columbia University convened by Frances Negr√≥n-Muntaner and
Sarah Muir. Intended as ‚Äúa carefully curated portal with various points
of entry,‚Äù its goal is that of exploring ‚Äúcritical questions about the
role of debt in contemporary capitalism; the relationship between debt,
migration, and violence, and the emergence of new political and cultural
identities.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Begun in 2017, <em>Puerto Rico Syllabus</em> (#PRSyllabus)
identifies salient themes related to Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic history,
offering a collaboratively curated bibliography (often linked to
full-text articles) to help the reader access relevant texts, videos,
and websites. Its proposed chronologically organized syllabus takes the
1898 US annexation of the island as a point of departure, exploring the
connections between imperial exploitation and the island‚Äôs 2017 filing
for bankruptcy protection, paying particular attention to recent
developments, such as the imposition of a fiscal control board in 2016,
and to the impact on the island‚Äôs already fragile economy of Hurricanes
Irma and Maria in September 2017. The site underscores its collaborative
nature by featuring a clear and prominent invitation to readers to join
the #PRSyllabus community as a subscriber to their list, as a
collaborator, or as a Twitter follower. Portions of the website are
translated into Spanish, with a declared intention to make the site more
bilingual and accessible.</p>

<p>#PRSyllabus is connected to the emergence of public syllabi as spaces
for educators to share materials, questions, and ideas for class
discussion of complex or difficult topics or events through a hashtag.
The first of these, #FergusonSyllabus, was developed by Marcia
Chatelain, an associate professor of history and African American
studies at Georgetown University, to support classroom conversations
about the fatal shooting of eighteen-year-old Michael Brown Jr. by a
white police officer in Fergusson, Missouri, in August 2014. Public
syllabi on the massacre at Charleston‚Äôs Emanuel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in June 2015; on Donald Trump‚Äôs election in 2016; on
the Black Lives Matter movement; on the Standing Rock Sioux in their
assertion of territorial sovereignty; on welfare reform, prison
abolition, immigration, Islamophobia, and (even) Colin Kaepernich have
followed. The format has proven popular among scholars engaged as a
community of like-minded peers seeking to facilitate access to carefully
selected resources from which other scholars can glean information,
guidance, and resources for teaching and research. This crowdsourcing of
ideas and information is well suited to collaborative endeavors that
benefit from access to a large network of potential contributors. In
their definition of <em>crowdsourcing</em>, Enrique Estell√©s-Arolas and
Fernando Gonz√°lez Ladr√≥n de Guevara underscore the participative nature
and online basis of a proposal from an individual or institution to ‚Äúa
group of individuals of varying knowledge, heterogeneity, and number,
via a flexible open call [for] the voluntary undertaking of a
task.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> #PRSyllabus is envisioned by its proponents as the first of
a series of related public syllabi focused on the destructive impact of
debt on Detroit, the Caribbean, Argentina, and Greece.</p>

<p><em>Puerto Rico Syllabus</em> pays careful attention to both the history of
Puerto Rico‚Äôs colonial economy and its present crisis, presenting its
multidisciplinary materials chronologically. This multidisciplinarity is
key to its success, since the syllabus succeeds in providing a broad
selection of materials that can be just as useful to the economist
aiming to present a broad spectrum of the various impacts of the crisis
on Puerto Rico‚Äôs population as to the literary or art historian seeking
to offer students an understanding of the crisis as a springboard to
more nuanced cultural analysis. As a collaborative work-in-process,
there is a degree of unevenness in the topics selected for inclusion as
well as in the amount of materials available under each topic. This is
natural in an organically developing collaboration, and the site will
find its balance as the project develops. One can see how new sections
will soon be needed‚Äîfor example, a section on Puerto Rico‚Äôs
environmental crisis, now covered primarily in the ‚ÄúHurricane Maria‚Äù
section‚Äîbut this is quite natural in dynamic projects such as this one.</p>

<p>The materials gathered at #PRSyllabus consists primarily of recent
articles, books, and scholarly essays‚Äîmost written after 2000‚Äîwith an
understandable preponderance of newspaper and magazine articles in the
approach to the present economic crisis. The readings are divided very
usefully into primary readings and items for ‚Äúfurther reading.‚Äù The
materials listed are relevant and informative, and the brief but very
helpful summaries of the contents of articles and essays guide the
would-be instructor toward a selection of nuanced analyses of the topics
offered for discussion. Most of the readings (except for book-length
studies) are accessible as full texts through links to other websites. A
number of very helpful videos (drawn from video-sharing websites like
YouTube and Vimeo) are also made available. The choice and relevance of
the materials‚Äîpredominantly secondary sources‚Äîcould be enhanced by the
inclusion of primary texts and historical documents, film, and
photographs through which students could learn additional analytical and
interpretative skills. These could also offer a first-hand contemporary
understanding of how past communities experienced this ongoing dynamic
crisis.</p>

<p>The project leaders and contributors envision a fully bilingual site and
have begun translating the contextualizing sections of the site
(‚ÄúAbout,‚Äù invitations to collaborate, etc.) from the original English
into Spanish. The developing site, however, assumes a bilingual reader
(instructor as well as student), since the articles and videos supplied
appear randomly in either Spanish or English, depending on their source
and provenance. This is, once again, a natural result of the project‚Äôs
collaborative practice, whose ideal ‚Äútarget‚Äù audience is clearly a
bilingual user. The site includes ‚Äú<a href="https://puertoricosyllabus.com/additional-resources/activists-organizations-and-citizen-initiatives/">Activist Organizations and Citizen
Initiatives</a>,‚Äù
a very helpful list of groups offering opportunities for users to become
involved in efforts to address the crisis more directly and personally.</p>

<p><em>Puerto Rico Syllabus</em>, built on a relatively simple WordPress theme, is
reasonably easy to navigate following the table of contents that runs
vertically down a right-hand sidebar accessible from all the website‚Äôs
pages, beginning with the landing page. The landing page itself
introduces the project and its team and invites engagement and
collaboration. It is free of ads. The site, nonetheless, could benefit
from a redesign featuring horizontal rather than vertical navigation. As
the number of topics on the sidebar continues to increase, the sidebar
navigation forces the visitor to scroll down vertically beyond the point
where the content of the main column ends. A horizontal menu near the
top of the page with nesting pages would facilitate navigation while
offering more flexibility in the organization of the materials, allowing
for the highlighting of new or special topics through the creative use
of widgets and footers. The landing page, where the viewer now scrolls
down to access the ‚ÄúAbout,‚Äù ‚ÄúGoals,‚Äù and ‚ÄúProject Leaders‚Äù sections, in
addition to a lengthy video titled <em>Exploring the Puerto Rico Syllabus
Project</em>, could benefit from being ‚Äúnested‚Äù horizontally below a footer
image in order to keep navigation functionality simple. As it stands
now, there is too much crucial information about the project ‚Äúbeneath
the fold.‚Äù A comparison of the site to the other public syllabi sites
highlighted on the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page shows the number of missed opportunities
at the design level.</p>

<p>Visually, the site‚Äôs appeal is limited. The WordPress theme used allows
for a custom background image and a choice of palettes, but the former
lacks definition and the latter‚Äîmaroon type on a white background‚Äîlacks
visual interest. The narrow visual impact comes from one photograph on
the landing page (not a banner image) and the occasional embedded
YouTube or Vimeo video. Given the wealth of visual materials associated
with the themes of debt, development, migration, and natural disasters
in Puerto Rico (which include the works of artists responding to the
2017 hurricanes), their incorporation into the site would both
contribute to its appeal to readers and provide a rich archive that
could be easily incorporated into the syllabus itself‚Äînot as mere points
of visual interest but as a fundamental contribution to the usefulness
of the site.</p>

<p>#PuertoRicoSyllabus is an excellent developing collaborative project
whose usefulness will continue to increase as we begin to understand the
crucial ramifications of Puerto Rico‚Äôs debt crisis and of the island‚Äôs
increased vulnerability to stronger and more destructive hurricanes as a
result of climate change. As a collaborative, crowdsourced project, it
has a great potential for growth. Its organizers should be commended for
their understanding of the importance of this moment in history, with
Puerto Rico at an economic and political crossroads, and for their
recognition of the need for collaboration and multidisciplinarity as the
perfect point of departure for teaching and scholarship.</p>
