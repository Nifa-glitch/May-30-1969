<p>Over the last ninety years, Haitian scholars and intellectuals have
published more than 260 issues and more than 1,300 articles in the pages
of the <em>Revue de la Soci√©t√© ha√Øtienne d‚Äôhistoire, de g√©ographie et de
g√©ologie</em> (<em>RSHHGG</em>). The publication is the greatest repository of
historical research produced on Haiti, from Haiti. We contend that
Haitian scholarly periodicals, and Caribbean periodicals more broadly,
are key sites of knowledge production that engage in a crucial critique
of North Atlantic episteme and infrastructures of information. Yet the
<em>RSHHGG</em> and other Caribbean periodicals like it are rarely cited by
scholars outside Haiti. Indeed, we argue that it is precisely <em>because</em>
Caribbean sites of knowledge production exist outside of‚Äîand in
critique of‚ÄîNorth Atlantic infrastructures of information that it
becomes acceptable, common even, for scholarship produced outside Haiti
to leave them uncited and unread.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Such a blind spot is even more
remarkable today, as North Atlantic scholars express ever more interest
in Haiti‚Äôs role in the Age of Revolution and studies of the Atlantic
world. Put otherwise: If the Haitian Revolution is central to the study
of the Atlantic world, why not Haitian histories and Haitian
historians?<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The gap between the vital importance of Haiti‚Äôs premier social science
journal and its relative lack of impact in North Atlantic scholarship
led to the creation of the <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/">RSHHGG Lab</a>, an
interactive online index of the nearly century‚Äôs worth of knowledge
produced in the <em>RSHHGG</em>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Developed at the intersection of
disciplinary fields and in cooperation with various institutional
partners, including the Soci√©t√© ha√Øtienne d‚Äôhistoire, de g√©ographie et
de g√©ologie (SHHGG), the Library of Congress‚Äôs Labs and John W. Kluge
Center, the Catholic University of America, and George Washington
University, this cross-boundary collaborative digital project was
designed to expand the impact of this crucial repository of Haitian
social science research. The project developed along the same lines of
what Marlene Daut has recently theorized as ‚Äúa Haitian-informed digital
praxis‚Äîcentered on access, content, context, and collaboration.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
It is an open-access, multilingual website (available in
<a href="http://rshhgglab.com/">English</a>,
<a href="http://rshhgglab.com/francais/">French</a>, and
<a href="http://rshhgglab.com/kreyol/">Kreyol</a>) that features a <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/search/">searchable
index</a> of every article published in the
<em>RSHHGG</em>, a growing collection of <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/annotations/">article

non-Haitian scholars and researchers, and a space for
<a href="http://rshhgglab.com/experiments/">experimentation</a>.</p>

<p>This essay analyzes the role that experimental work played in the
multi-institutional, cross-boundary collaborative construction of this
DH project. Here, we understand experimentation to be a mindset, an
attitude of ‚Äútry it and see what happens‚Äù through iterative small risks
and an openness to involving others and changing direction. This
approach draws on the spirit of collaboration, experimentation, and
sharing that informs the <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/">LC Labs</a> initiative at
the Library of Congress, and the <em>revue</em> (magazine-journal) as a print
space of exchange, confrontation, and collective creation.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Following
recent reflections on information maintenance and care ethics, we agree
that infrastructures of information maintenance are often invisible and
institutionally siloed and often reproduce structures of oppression and
silencing.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> We aim here to highlight the institutional and
infrastructural experimentation and labor necessary to create what is,
essentially, a project of information management: making a key
repository of knowledge usable, discoverable, and accessible. The
authors contend that experimental work was central to successfully
working within‚Äîand also challenging‚Äîextant infrastructures of
information maintenance in order to achieve an independent, sustainable
project with room to grow and transform.</p>

<p>In what follows, we consider the process of knowledge-creation in the
history of the SHHGG and the nearly one-hundred-year existence of its
<em>Revue</em>, the process of indexing this original source material into
database form, and transforming this database into a workable digital
product. In each of these stages, experimentation and cross-boundary
collaboration were key‚Äîbetween the humanities and library science
disciplines, between expectations and realities, and between multiple
languages and registers: Kreyol, French, English, and code. In attending
to the various processes of experimentation that underwrote the RSHHGG
Lab, the authors hope to demonstrate the fruitfulness of cross-boundary
collaborative projects and, ultimately, to advocate for more
infrastructures of experimentation in many forms: research leave, labs,
residencies, and further creative approaches to blurring the boundaries
of labor.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Soci√©t√© ha√Øtienne d‚Äôhistoire, de g√©ographie et de g√©ologie
celebrated its ninety-sixth anniversary.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Its survival is no small
feat: Haitian society has long experienced the kind of tumult that takes
down those institutions in civil society committed to critical
reflection, knowledge, and scientific research. The SHHGG is considered
the eldest among Haiti‚Äôs scientific, educational institutions, perhaps
the oldest learned society in the Caribbean region still in existence
today. Its press organ, the <em>Revue de la Soci√©t√© ha√Øtienne d‚Äôhistoire,
de g√©ographie et de g√©ologie</em>, is a standard bearer and scientific
publication of reference in Haiti, given that so few scientific
periodicals are currently published in Haiti, especially with
regularity. In many respects, the <em>Revue</em> attests to the level of
critical reflection, studies, and research in social sciences undertaken
in Haiti, by Haitians. These background paragraphs are designed to give
an idea of the evolution of the SHHGG and the <em>Revue</em> from 1923 to today
and the importance of these institutions in the intellectual sphere and
the world of scientific research in Haiti. By bearing witness to the
century of knowledge produced within the pages of the <em>Revue</em>, we hope
to shed light on the stakes of information infrastructures that do not
sufficiently render this knowledge accessible.</p>

<p>The society was founded officially on 8 December 1923 during the
political and military occupation of Haiti by the United States
(1915‚Äì34).<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> A group of notable historians, professors,
intellectuals, and politicians came together with the goal of producing
historical works of scientific value on Haiti‚Äôs history in order to
loosen the grip of the US occupation.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> The society‚Äôs first president,
Horacius Paul√©us Sannon, echoed these efforts in one of his early
speeches, excerpted here: ‚ÄúIn times of great crisis, all people
instinctively look back to their history to find lessons of collective
patriotism, new rules of conduct either to better defend their
threatened existence, or to lift themselves back up after they fall. . .
. Each people‚Äôs history is the unique source from which flows or renews,
depending on the circumstances, its legitimate and indestructible
national aspirations.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> To achieve these political goals, the
society defined a set of concrete objectives: to create a list of the
country‚Äôs private archives that related to national history and
geography; to establish a complete, accurate index of scholarly works
dedicated to Haitian history and geography by Haitian or foreign
authors; to encourage the publication of works aimed at making Haiti
better known from a historical and geographical point of view; and to
facilitate the diffusion of historical and geographical knowledge among
the Haitian people.</p>

<p>The first issue of the <em>Revue</em> appeared on 1 May 1925 under the title
<em>Bulletin de la Soci√©t√©</em> <em>d‚Äôhistoire et de g√©ographie d‚ÄôHa√Øti</em> and
quickly filled a gap in Haitian society.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Because of a lack of
funds, the second issue was not published until December 1926. In this
second issue, the board of directors replaced the name <em>bulletin</em> with
<em>revue</em>, which has been maintained to the present day, and the journal
name later reflected the changes to the society‚Äôs name (see note 7).
Though it was born out of the political circumstances of the US
occupation, the SHHGG as an institution exists independently of the
Haitian state and works to maintain its existence outside the government
or a political regime. Put otherwise: the SHHGG is not an institution
formed by the political authority of the state, but in its own sphere of
work it contributes to the development of the Haitian state.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The
society‚Äôs collaboration with government bodies (notably with the
Ministry of National Education, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
more recently with the Ministry of Culture) can be fruitful or fraught,
depending on political circumstances. The well-known saying is that the
society does not get involved with government politics. For the most
part, the members of the management committee have always tried to
maintain the autonomy of the organization‚Äôs operations, its independence
as an association, and its status as a learned society in the face of
power. Nevertheless, an individual member can be involved in a
particular government as she sees fit. Indeed, the society has often
been led by key figures who have occupied high-ranking positions in the
state and the university, while several Haitian presidents were close to
the SHHGG. By commitment to maintain a division between the actions of
individual members and the autonomy of the organization, the society has
weathered the convulsions and commotions so favored in the country‚Äôs
political arena. The existence of the SHHGG first and foremost!</p>

<p>This is not to say that political turmoil has not had an impact on the
society and the <em>Revue</em>. On the contrary, Haiti‚Äôs political
transformations have had repercussions, directly or indirectly, on the
evolution of the SHHGG and the <em>Revue</em> either in terms of financial
resources or the integration of new historians, researchers, and young
professionals in its activities. Today, the current 2018‚Äì19 political
crisis‚Äîknown as <em>peyi l√≤k</em> (country lock)‚Äîhas negatively affected
the production of the journal, the society‚Äôs main office, the financial
resources needed to publish the <em>Revue</em>, and the general ability to
realize the SHHGG‚Äôs programming.</p>

</div>

<p>With the benefit of data visualization from the RSHHGG Lab index, the
impact of the Duvalier dictatorship on the <em>Revue</em>‚Äôs output is clear,
though it warrants some additional contextualization here.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> When
Fran√ßois Duvalier came to power in 1957, Jean Price-Mars was president
of the society. In declining health, Price-Mars had planned to hand over
leadership of the organization to a joint group of young historians:
Leslie F. Manigat (future president of the Republic), G√©rard Mentor
Laurent, and H√©nock Trouillot. But under Duvalier‚Äôs increasingly
repressive regime, Manigat and Laurent left the country, one after the
other‚Äîalbeit for different reasons and by different means. Only the
intrepid Trouillot, a faithful disciple of the social theorist
Price-Mars, remained to take the reins.</p>

<p>Many could assume that the society and the <em>Revue</em> during H√©nock
Trouillot‚Äôs tenure were simply a tool for Duvalierist propaganda. After
all, Duvalier and Trouillot knew each other well: Duvalier had
previously cowritten articles for the <em>Revue</em> with Lorimer Denis and had
even participated in some of the society‚Äôs activities.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
Nevertheless, Trouillot chose not to align the SHHGG behind Duvalier‚Äôs
regime and did not turn the <em>Revue</em> into an outlet for the political
discourse of Duvalierism. As such, Trouillot assumed sole responsibility
for the society and for the <em>Revue</em> for eighteen years at a time when
many intellectuals had left Haiti under the dictatorship. During the
1960s and 1970s Trouillot did his utmost, sometimes at his own expense
and through his sole intellectual labor, to publish the <em>Revue</em>. In
comparison to other decades of the <em>Revue</em>, his was a modest output but
one that allowed the society and its project to survive.</p>

<p>Without institutional or managerial support, the weight of these
professional and intellectual obligations took a toll on Trouillot‚Äôs
health. At the initiative of a group of intellectuals, including the
renowned historians Jean Fouchard and G√©rard Mentor Laurent (back in
Haiti after a diplomatic mission to Africa), the Ministry of Education
asked Trouillot to retire as the head of the society. Mentor Laurent
presided over a new executive committee, which had been appointed to
restructure the society. The 1980s marked a new era for the society and
the <em>Revue</em>. Under the leadership of Alain Turnier, the society created
its history prize and welcomed the first woman into the organization‚Äôs
leadership, the specialist of library science Fran√ßoise Thybulle, who
was then director of the Biblioth√®que nationale d‚ÄôHa√Øti.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> After the
fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier and the end of the Duvalier dictatorship in
February 1986, a new group of scholars joined the management committee,
including Michel Hector, Suzy Castor, Gusti-Klara Gaillard, and Pierre
Buteau. Hector served for fifteen years as president (2000‚Äì2015), and
it is with great sadness that the authors of this article acknowledge
his passing on 5 July 2019.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<p>Today, Pierre Buteau serves as president of the society, and the
management committee is comprised of Guerdy Lissade, vice-president;
Watson Denis, general secretary; Ampidu Lewis Clorm√©us, secretary; and
advisory board members Gusti- Klara Gaillard-Pourchet, Itazienne Eug√®ne,
Marc-Antoine Archin, Michel Acacia, Gladys Berrouet, and Marc D√©sir.
Membership in the SHHGG is work of charity, goodwill, and patriotism; no
one receives a salary. In the spirit of reconstruction and renewal that
followed the terrible earthquake of 12 January 2010, the society has
taken steps to contribute to this common project of rebuilding Haiti.
Since 2013, the SHHGG has leased a space where it can organize academic
activities and cultural programming (conferences, book launches, history
workshops, seminars, debates, and meetings of all kinds). The <em>Revue</em>
has followed suit. Since 2011, the management committee has adopted
norms and protocols for the presentation and submission of articles and
essays. These have greatly facilitated the editorial work of the
<em>Revue</em>, most notably regarding the uniformization of articles and the
quality and level of the publication.</p>

<h2 id="decolonizing-infrastructures-of-information-maintenance">Decolonizing Infrastructures of Information Maintenance</h2>

<p>Multiple levels of experimentation and cross-boundary collaboration
shaped the conception, design, and realization of the RSHHGG Lab digital
index project. The project itself developed during Chelsea Stieber‚Äôs
research fellowship at the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of
Congress for the academic year 2016‚Äì17. It is important to note,
however, that she had not applied specifically for a DH residence; she
was there to complete research on her book project on civil war and
factionalism in postindependence Haitian writing. Nevertheless, because
of the cross-boundary work encouraged within the Kluge Center and the LC
Labs initiative specifically, she was given the time, space, and
resources (Kluge interns, <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/people/">LC Labs
fellows</a>, technology, and expertise) to
pursue the project.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> It would be useful, then, to first understand
the process by which the need for the index became clear.</p>

<p>If, as we maintain in the introduction to this essay, Caribbean
periodicals are crucial sites of knowledge production, why does
scholarship produced <em>outside</em> the Caribbean leave them uncited and
unread? Or, to return to our opening gambit: If the Haitian Revolution
is central to the study of the Atlantic World, why not Haitian histories
and Haitian historians? Here, let us make the case more clearly
regarding the silencing of twentieth-century Caribbean periodicals
within North Atlantic infrastructures of information maintenance via
Stieber‚Äôs experience with the periodical in the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>Stieber‚Äôs residence at the Kluge Center was focused on the Library of
Congress‚Äôs vast collection of locally produced Haitian scholarship:
monographs, newspapers, and journals, mostly from the twentieth century.
Her emphasis on locally produced print materials, especially
periodicals, is part of a larger research imperative that she has called
attention to in her other work.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> She had dedicated a large portion
of her time to working her way through the nearly full run of the
<em>RSHHGG</em> in the library‚Äôs holdings, one of the only such collections
that exists in the United States, observing research trends, identifying
notable contributors, and flagging articles to read in full. She quickly
realized that it would not be so easy. A catalog search of the
periodical revealed only the most basic information,
‚ÄúHistory‚ÄîPeriodicals,‚Äù and no indication of the contents of individual
issues. This periodical, one of the Caribbean‚Äôs most important social
science journals, was virtually opaque to normal scholarly searching
practices. More onerous still, the early issues through 1950 were only
available on microfilm.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->

<div class="image-wrapper">
    
        <img src="/images/issue04/stieber/stieber-image_3.png" alt="Library of Congress Catalog Entry" />
    
        
<span class="caption">Figure 3. Library of Congress catalog entry for the *Revue de la Soci√©t√© ha√Øtienne d\'histoire, de g√©ographie et de g√©ologie*.</span>
    
</div>

<p>Stieber‚Äôs initial exploratory research into these questions identified
two main reasons for this lack of engagement with Haitian scholarly and
intellectual production: language and accessibility. The primary
language of Haitian scholarship is French and, more recently, Haitian
Kreyol‚Äîbarriers to access for most anglophone scholars. The question
of accessibility is not only linguistic, however, nor is it unique to
Haitian periodicals. Rather, it has to do with infrastructures of
information maintenance: the indexing and library cataloguing practices
for scholarly periodicals.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress‚Äôs depth of reference staff and subject
librarians allowed Stieber to connect quickly by phone with a reference
staff in the Newspaper and Current Periodical Reading Room. She learned
that when libraries process incoming periodicals, they create a catalog
entry that includes the basic information about the publication: title,
publisher, frequency, and a basic subject heading. While libraries will
routinely update the catalog record with the most recent holdings,
adding catalog notes on editors, reprints, and other information, these
catalog records do not index the <em>contents</em> of the periodical itself:
the different article titles, author names, and subject headings for
each issue. Which is to say, there was nothing specific to the
Caribbeanness of the <em>RSHHGG</em> that rendered it opaque within the library
catalog. All periodicals, from the <em>American Historical Review</em> (<em>AHR</em>)
to the modernist magazine <em>The Dial</em> are more or less illegible in the
library catalog. Indeed, this is precisely how the catalog is designed
to work, as the reference staff explained. While in the predigital past,
researchers would use the printed volume index of the specific
periodical that interested them, today, virtually all North Atlantic
scholarly periodicals have searchable indexes online via JSTOR,
ProQuest, or Project MUSE, for example. Crucially, these periodicals
have also merged their archives onto these digital platforms: the <em>AHR</em>
is searchable and browsable from volume 1 (1895) to present.</p>

<p>But it is the comparison between Caribbean scholarly periodicals and
modernist magazines (rather than North Atlantic scholarly periodicals)
that is, we think, a more fruitful one. Modernist magazines were long
thought of as the excluded or silenced site of knowledge creation and
artistic experimentation in twentieth-century infrastructures of
information maintenance. Their ephemeral, countercultural, and
avant-garde status meant that they did not assimilate easily into the
catalog or the archive, which was often their purpose in the first
place: to challenge epistemological frames, systems of value, and
notions of art. But they have long since been attended to, and we would
venture, never really silenced: they have been chronicled in scholarly
monographs and articles, in anthologies, and, in the last twenty years,
in massive, sustained digital archiving projects, such as the <a href="http://modjourn.org/">Modernist
Journals Project</a>.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> Yet for the
<em>RSHHGG</em>, and for most other foreign-language, non-US-based scholarly
periodicals from earlier in the twentieth century, there is no such
searchable index, no such online platform for their archives.</p>

<p>The absence of care or maintenance work for Caribbean scholarly
periodicals is in no small part a result of their marginal status within
the Western episteme and their distance from the dominant discourses and
arbiters of North Atlantic scholarly production. While modernist
magazines were avant-garde and enjoyed a provocative, outsider status to
the dominant norms of late Victorian or nineteenth-century art,
literature, and culture, they nevertheless made this critique from
within Western institutions and infrastructures. We cannot say the same
for Haitian scholarly periodicals, which produced their knowledge
outside the dominant Western discourse, in their own centers of
knowledge and episteme. Non-Western or non-North Atlantic scholarly
periodicals are inscrutable in the catalog and, as a result, are
silent‚Äîand silenced‚Äîin North Atlantic scholarship, even, perversely,
scholarship that purports to be on or about these regions. We therefore
believe it is absolutely necessary for North Atlantic scholars to engage
Haitian-based scholarly and intellectual production when they are
writing and thinking about Haiti. In short: we need new structures of
information maintenance that render visible, legible, and searchable the
scholarly and intellectual production that exists outside the dominant
(Western) infrastructure‚Äîprecisely because this work challenges the
logic and episteme of these dominant frames.</p>

<p>The complex interplay of silence, inequity, and illegibility
(re)produced between infrastructures of information maintenance and
North Atlantic scholarship led Stieber to a series of provocations,
elaborated in dialogue with the <a href="http://smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos/index.html"><em>Small Axe
Archipelagos</em></a> project,
that informed the shape of the project to come: How can we unsilence
locally produced Caribbean knowledge within North Atlantic
infrastructures of information maintenance and render if more accessible
and legible for a public that should be reading and citing it? In the
process of doing this, how can we ensure that we are doing this work in
a way that actually strengthens the infrastructures and institutions in
the Caribbean that generated this work? Finally, might we be able to
decolonize North Atlantic research and citational practices on and about
the Caribbean by indexing and making more accessible and legible key
resources in twentieth-century Caribbean scholarly and intellectual
production?<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="cross-boundary-collaboration-as-experimentation">Cross-Boundary Collaboration as Experimentation</h2>

<p>The creation of the searchable index was possible only through
multi-institutional, cross-boundary collaborative experimentation. Here,
we will narrate collaborative work that was central to successfully
working within‚Äîand also challenging‚Äîextant infrastructures of
information maintenance in order to make scholarly production from Haiti
legible to non-Haitian scholars who are writing and thinking about
Haiti. First and foremost was to secure support from the SHHGG, which
Stieber considered the primary stakeholder in the project. If the idea
was indeed to make Haitian scholarly production accessible, it was also
to create an information infrastructure that directly involved the
institution, organizational structures, and people involved with the
SHHGG. The society expressed their support for the indexing project but
reiterated their opposition to any digitization because of valid
concerns that digitization alone would not ensure North Atlantic
scholars‚Äô engagement with Haiti and its institutions (what Daut rightly
calls ‚Äúthe ‚ÄòColumbusing‚Äô of Haitian-produced scholarship‚Äù).<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> By
engaging the SHHGG as a stakeholder in the project, Stieber connected
with the organization‚Äôs general secretary, Watson Denis, who became an
invaluable liaison to the society and a central collaborator for the
indexing project.</p>

<p>In a stroke of coincidence and true luck, Adam Silvia, a seasoned
Caribbeanist and digital humanist, had just arrived at the Library of
Congress to start a new job. A historian by training, Silvia had long
believed that the <em>RSHHGG</em> was a precious resource that deserved wider
use among scholars. He offered crucial advice in this early stage of the
project, setting up a workflow to index the contents of the journal in
order to make them accessible, legible, and discoverable. It is this
first stage of infrastructural information maintenance that is both the
most laborious and often the most invisible.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> It would not do to
give it short shrift here. Over the course of a calendar year, Silvia
(off the clock, in his personal time); a Kluge Center intern, Chadwick
Dunefsky; and a Catholic University of America PhD candidate and
graduate research assistant, Maria Jose Gutierrez, assisted Stieber in
indexing the contents of each issue of the periodical into a database
that recorded author, title, issue and volume numbers, notes, and
library location (1,381 items in all). The Catholic University of
America Interlibrary Loan Staff provided invaluable assistance tracking
down newer or missing issues. Without the care and expertise of these
contributors, the project would not have been possible.</p>

<p>As the indexing phase neared completion, the LC Labs and visiting
librarian Laura Wrubel provided Stieber invaluable guidance and
consultation on how to turn this dataset into an index on a digital
platform. The ‚Äúguiding principles‚Äù of accessibility and sustainability
that Stieber brought to this next stage of the project were essential to
narrow down all the possibilities and stick to the guiding ethos of the
project. The accessibility piece was inspired by the Small
Axe Archipelagos project, which emphasizes critical thinking in digital
humanities scholarship in order to ‚Äúencourage collaboration with,
increase accessibility for, and otherwise work to narrow the gap between
Caribbeanist researchers, especially those in the North Atlantic
academy, and the communities we are committed to serving.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> The
sustainability piece came from the principles of minimal computing
utilized by Alex Gil and others, which advocates finding a balance
between ‚Äúhigh-performance‚Äù technology and a sustainable, data ‚Äúlight‚Äù
site (ideal for Caribbean users who access on their mobile phones using
3G data) that is easy to maintain in the long-term.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup></p>

<p>Wrubel, a librarian and software developer at George Washington
University, was at that time commencing three months of research leave,
pursuing professional development goals related to digital scholarship
and computational analysis of library collections.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> Librarians at
George Washington University are granted the opportunity‚Äîrelatively
unique in academic librarianship‚Äîto propose research leave projects of
up to six months in support of goals related to research, teaching, and
professional development. Wrubel‚Äôs goals included developing her
expertise with software tools for analysis and exploration of library
digital collections; contributing to the efforts of LC Labs to implement
services for digital scholarship at Library of Congress; and
experimenting with the Library of Congress resources, such as their
APIs, to create demonstration projects and documentation.</p>

<p>As background, in 2016, the Library of Congress commissioned a study of
library digital scholarship services and conducted a pilot in order to
provide recommendations about how the library could more robustly
support digital methods and computational analysis using their
collections.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> The report recommended development of a lab that would
foster experimentation and provide expertise for researchers, including
Kluge scholars, in use of digital collections and related workflows and
tools. It recommended that a Library of Congress Lab be accessible to
all and provide instruction and access to data scholarship methods for
research with digital collections. As a visiting librarian in LC Labs,
Wrubel sought to contribute to the LC Labs team‚Äôs efforts to gain
experience with the needs of digital scholarship projects and foster
experiments that would inspire others. The team had already been
facilitating the work of Kluge scholars studying digital collections,
and it was through their bridge-building that Wrubel was connected with
Stieber.</p>

<p>At the start of their collaboration, Wrubel took on the role of a
facilitator of experimentation. As a librarian working with faculty and
students to apply technological and often exploratory approaches to
their research, this was a role with which she had experience. She first
sought to understand the story of the RSHHGG Lab project to that date,
including Stieber‚Äôs immediate goals for the project and her dreams for
its future, as well as the agreed-upon guidelines set forth by the
SHHGG‚Äôs executive committee.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> This conversation was similar in some
ways to the ‚Äúwhiteboard dream containment technique‚Äù in which the
interpreter (Wrubel) and her colleagues in LC Labs would take the
preliminary ideas about the shape of the project as envisioned by the
dreamer (Stieber), draw out requirements, and ‚Äúreduce the scope of the
project to a minimally viable interpretation in which the dreamer still
recognizes her initial desires.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> Wrubel would work with Stieber to
develop an achievable path for the project that would meet her
short-term goal to make the <em>RSHHGG</em>‚Äôs contents discoverable, on a
platform she could take forward beyond the project‚Äôs origins at Library
of Congress, all while respecting her guiding principles of
accessibility and sustainability. Through these conversations, Wrubel
and Stieber developed the technical requirements for this online version
of the project. It needed to</p>

<ul>
  <li>display citations from the journal by year, tag, author, and
possibly other ways;</li>
  <li>support searching citations by keyword in any field including
abstract;</li>
  <li>be searchable or browseable by tag;</li>
  <li>load quickly on mobile devices with limited bandwidth;</li>
  <li>show the work as it‚Äôs completed (annotations and citations were to
be added over time); and</li>
  <li>be easy to customize and maintain, as well as be portable and
independent of any organizational home.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last item was of particular concern, since both Stieber and Wrubel
were working on this project while on a fellowship and research leave,
respectively. Although Stieber was pursuing funding from other sources,
RSHHGG Lab needed to survive independent of any particular institution‚Äôs
support and to facilitate the future integration of other partners. In
addition to supporting the goals of the project as a whole, the platform
must require minimal technical effort and funding to update, migrate,
and keep current; allow others to contribute to the technical and
data-related work of the project; and provide an exit strategy for the
data, to enable future migrations to other platforms. These criteria
relate directly to accessibility, sustainability and maintenance
considerations.</p>

<p>At the initial stage of the work, Stieber and Wrubel examined the
article data Stieber and her team had created in their work with the
<em>RSHHGG</em>‚Äôs print volumes. The approximately eight hundred citations they
created were in a Google Sheet, with columns for each citation field.
Google Sheets had proven helpful in supporting collaboration on data
entry but did not enforce consistent metadata practices. As a result of
the many participants in data entry, inconsistencies in formatting and
gaps crept into the citations. For example, date formats varied, start
and end pages were in the same column, and varying placeholder text was
used for articles with no authors. Wrubel identified clean-up tasks that
would make the citation data more amenable to transformation into other
formats and usable in digital platforms. This work surfaced the value of
collaborating with a librarian throughout the process but especially in
the initial stages to plan how data will be gathered and managed in a
digital project. Early consideration of data structure and formats can
enable easier integration and transformation later.</p>

<p>While this data clean-up was continuing, Wrubel investigated platforms
that met the requirements of the project, prioritizing those that would
enable Stieber to control the data and its presentation, and would be
appropriate for her and her collaborators‚Äô technical skills and
resources. Zotero had emerged as a key part of the technical approach,
since it provides easy management of large numbers of citations and data
portability. Wrubel wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/lwrubel/e6e8acfa6318771fa4383cabec05f798"><em>Python
script</em></a>
for a one-time transformation of a CSV (comma-separated values) export
of the data in the Google Sheet into the RIS format (citation format
developed by Research Information Systems)that is easily imported into
Zotero. She walked Stieber through the Python code, ensuring that
Stieber had Python set up on her own laptop so she would be empowered to
work with the data and tools herself or with other collaborators.</p>

<p>To understand the affordances of possible platforms, Wrubel created
several prototypes using similar citation data. Prototyping helped
Wrubel understand and communicate each approach‚Äôs features, setup and
maintenance needs, and trade-offs. Prototyping allowed Stieber to
envision how each approach might manifest and to make decisions about
the project as an informed collaborator. To more speedily set up
prototypes, Wrubel used Docker, containerization software for deploying
applications and their dependencies, which draws on a public repository
of images for these containers. WordPress and Omeka both were available
as Docker images that Wrubel could download and deploy with minimal
setup and configuration.</p>

<p>WordPress with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zotpress/"><em>Zotpress
plug-in</em></a> offered the easiest
setup and maintenance and flexibility in how the site looks and works,
and it took advantage of Zotero‚Äôs ease of managing large numbers of
citations. Hosting for WordPress is widely available, including from
Reclaim Hosting, and it has simple themes available for supporting fast
load times. No server administrator is required, and a GUI (graphical
user interface) admin site is available for managing the site. The
Zotpress plug-in displays citations from Zotero, retrieved in real-time
via Zotero‚Äôs API (application programming interface) and has various
filters available. All components were actively being updated and
maintained. Setting up the prototype helped demonstrate the limitations
of options for displaying items, such as the lack of API support for a
query by volume number, a common need for journal data. Also, display is
based on a live API call, so results can take a second or two to load,
no matter what the user‚Äôs bandwidth.</p>

<p>Wrubel also prototyped an Omeka site that used the Zotero Import
plug-in. This approach requires more manual effort to configure and load
data. The Omeka web-publishing software for exhibits and digital
collection allows the user to import citations from Zotero as items to
display in an exhibit. Because data is usually loaded only once, not
changed over time, it would work better with a finished project with a
complete set of citations and annotations.</p>

<p>Wrubel also explored the static site generator Jekyll but did not
recommend it to Stieber. While Jekyll is lightweight, widely used, and
customizable with plug-ins, this project had too many citations to
manually maintain within the Jekyll pages and posts framework. Adding
searchability through a plug-in such as lunr.js would be cumbersome,
considering the number of records (citations). It is against the grain
of Jekyll usage to integrate a database, nor was there at the time a
Zotero plug-in for Jekyll. Wrubel also looked at Open Journal Systems,
an open-source journal hosting platform that provides built-in
navigation for a journal. While its website structure and layout matches
the shape of the project, it requires either a system administrator or
developer to set it up and maintain it or third-party hosting, which
requires funding on an annual subscription basis.</p>

<p>Based on the review of options, Stieber selected the WordPress and
Zotpress platform. In addition to the advantages already described, she
knew that at her home institution there were graduate students and
librarians knowledgeable about WordPress and Zotero and that therefore
those applications would more easily enable future collaboration. We
must acknowledge the contributors, maintainers, and communities behind
the software and platforms we explored and used in this project.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup>
These open-source projects are critical infrastructure for digital
projects such as RSHHGG Lab. And while we ended up not selecting Jekyll
or Omeka, using them in our prototyping helped us clarify our needs and
contributed to our understanding of how the project might develop in the
future. The process of experimentally configuring projects with a small
set of citation data revealed the affordances of each tool, highlighting
the consequences of any set of design choices and feeding our
imaginations of what a fully developed lab site could offer.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-searchable-online-index">Creating a Searchable Online Index</h2>

<p>Wrubel‚Äôs Python script, while simple, was the keystone to being able to
move the database from CSV to a useable, searchable, accessible online
platform. This transition to the final WordPress phase came at a good
time: Wrubel had since returned to George Washington University and
assumed her regular duties. Stieber, now back at Catholic University
herself, would (in theory) be able to manage the WordPress setup and
ZotPress integration on her own. In another stroke of luck, Anne Nguyen,
a brilliant high school senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for
Science and Technology was eager to experiment with her knowledge of
French and computer science. She spent a few weeks of her summer break
working on tagging schemes and cleaning up the Zotero bibliography.
Christian James, a web application librarian at Catholic University
Libraries, also proved indispensable in the site-building phase, helping
Stieber to work out kinks in the ZotPress code and consulting as
needed.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> The end result: a relatively data-light site that queried
our original (and easily updatable) Zotero bibliography through a
searchable index by item, by tag, and with a ‚Äúbrowse by‚Äù option. Because
of our emphasis on legibility and accessibility, we provided the main
site information, including directions for searching, browsing, and
about the lab, in English, French, and Kreyol. Paul Belony, PhD,
provided Kreyol translations for the site, while Karine Belizar, a PhD
candidate at Louisiana State University, provided French translations.</p>

<p>Because the project was designed to be more than just an index, Stieber
sought ideas for how to make it into a dynamic space of collaboration
and exchange that would bridge the North Atlantic/Haitian divide. Here,
Adam Silvia‚Äôs previous experience curating the project <a href="http://islandluminous.fiu.edu/"><em>An Island
Luminous</em></a> was invaluable.<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Silvia
suggested a model of scholarly annotations similar to that project: we
would send out a call for collaborators to researchers of all levels
throughout Haiti and the North Atlantic (primarily the United States,
Canada, and France) in
<a href="http://rshhgglab.com/call-for-collaborators-rshhgg-lab/">English</a>,
<a href="http://rshhgglab.com/appel-aux-collaborateurs-le-labo-rshhgg/">French</a>,
and <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/apel-pou-kolaborasyon/">Kreyol</a>.<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> Because
the articles themselves would not be accessible, the idea was to create
an online, collaborative space for scholars inside and outside Haiti to
write short summaries of articles they had used from the journal for
their own research. The annotations are a space especially of research
collaboration and cross-boundary collaboration: they indicate if and in
what publication the original journal article has been cited and are
beginning to link to related digital scholarly projects (such as the
<a href="https://repository.duke.edu/dc/radiohaiti">Radio Haiti Archive</a>).<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup>
During this process, Nathan Dize, a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt
University, was instrumental. He outlined a social media and
communications strategy and worked with <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/collaborators/">contributing
annotators</a>.<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> Many of these
main project partners have themselves contributed article annotations to
the site, all of which you can find <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/annotations/">in the site‚Äôs annotations
section</a>. The site also seeks to be
useful to its other stakeholders‚Äîthe researchers who use and
contribute to it‚Äîas academic ‚Äúcapital‚Äù on a curriculum vitae or in a
promotion dossier. To that end, we have maintained a scholarly editing
process: Matthew Casey, a historian at the University of Southern
Mississippi, serves as the English-language annotations editor, and
Vanessa Mongey, a historian at Newcastle University (UK), is the
French-language annotations editor.</p>

<p>So far, the site has achieved its goal of increasing the searchability
and accessibility of the journal: in its first year, it logged nearly
twenty thousand visits and received positive feedback from Haitian and
North Atlantic scholars alike. Marlene Daut has recently called the site
a ‚Äúmodel for a digital project that has the capacity to ensure that
Haitian scholars are neither silenced nor exploited in this moment of
resurgent interest in Haitian history.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> Still, there remain
processes to be improved and further outreach to be done. The
flexibility for experimentation provided by a non‚Äìinstitutionally bound
project also created a spotty, ad-hoc workflow that we need to improve.
Moreover, while there has been fruitful collaboration with Haitian
scholars, we can do more to create an egalitarian, collaborative
scholarly exchange, primarily through groundwork and outreach in Haiti.</p>

<p>Stieber participated in one such outreach event when she visited the
headquarters of the SHHGG in November 2018. She presented the project
and its successes in making Haitian scholarly production accessible
while also creating a system that directly involved the institution,
infrastructure, and people involved with the SHHGG. Having laid the
framework for a collaborative digital space that serves North Atlantic
scholars <em>and</em> Haitian researchers, we hope a next step can be to work
with the SHHGG to create a digital archive of the <em>RSHHGG.</em> The idea
would be to use a more traditional journal storage site using the
<a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/">Public Knowledge Project‚Äôs Open Journals
System</a> or some other open-source software CMS
(content management system), which would be geared primarily to North
Atlantic scholars.<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> In light of the constraints on data usage and
insufficient WiFi in Haiti, we would also create a physical archive on
external hard drives, thumb drives, or, in an ideal situation, a
Raspberry Pi minicomputer that would be geared toward a local, Haitian
scholarly community.<sup id="fnref:37" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">37</a></sup> Because the device does not need to be
connected to the internet and can emit its own WiFi signal, users
(patrons of the SHHGG reading room or perhaps another library or
community center) could connect to the archive with phones, tablets, or
computers and download directly without using data. Such a setup would
allow us to create a more vibrant, dynamic community space centered on
the exchange and creation of knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The case of the <em>RSHHGG</em> and its silence in North Atlantic scholarship
is far from unique. Scholarly and cultural knowledge from the
Caribbean‚Äîand the global South more broadly‚Äîsits in the pages of
unindexed periodicals. The opacity or unsearchability of locally
produced, nonanglophone scholarly periodicals like the <em>RSHHGG</em> (from
the Caribbean, Latin America, and elsewhere in the global South) is
especially important to recognize <em>and rectify</em> because these are the
scholarly sites‚Äîand centers‚Äîof local scholarly and intellectual
production. In the spirit of experimentation and the ‚ÄúLab,‚Äù we have just
launched our first <a href="http://rshhgglab.com/experiments/">experiment</a> on
the site: a crowd-sourced list of locally produced Caribbean
periodicals.<sup id="fnref:38" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> It is our hope that we can further emphasize the
importance of locally produced Caribbean periodicals as sites of
knowledge production that challenge dominant ways of knowing and
infrastructures of information and catalyze additional projects to
render them accessible and legible.</p>

<p>There are many models for institutionally structuring the work of
digital scholarship, from centers to collectives, and for fostering
partnerships among scholars, librarians, archivists, and
technologists.<sup id="fnref:39" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Stieber, Wrubel, and Denis‚Äôs collaborative effort
overlapped with several organizational support arrangements, developing
fluidly as the project‚Äôs context changed. This changing context allowed
for experimentation less bound by institutional mandates or competing
responsibilities, and yet these collaborations also provided benefits to
many home organizations over time. LC Labs gained experience supporting
Kluge scholars and facilitating digital projects, while also being able
to showcase a ‚Äúcollections as data‚Äù project that could inspire others to
explore Library of Congress collections. Wrubel‚Äôs institution benefits
from her deepened experience with digital scholarship projects, exposure
to digital humanities projects, and practical understanding of tools.
She has been able to draw on what she learned from this project to
facilitate and advise others in her library and academic community.
Stieber‚Äôs institution benefitted from the visibility of her project in
the world and the new insights and methodologies for scholarly practice
that she brings to her teaching and research. Denis and the SHHGG
received greater visibility and impact while maintaining the scholarly
and intellectual capital of their work within their institutional
infrastructures at home. We and our many partners are experimenters and
collaborators but also information maintainers who have the
responsibility and opportunity to ensure the continued existence of an
entry point to this periodical. We look forward to adapting and
experimenting as we continue to the next stage of the RSHHGG Lab.</p>

      <p>The society‚Äôs history prize was inaugurated in 1982. The first
prize was awarded in 1984 to Marcel and Claude B. Auguste for their
work <em>L‚Äôexp√©dition Leclerc, 1801‚Äì1802</em> and the second prize to
Emmanuel Justin Castra for his work entitled, <em>Aux origines de la
presse ha√Øtienne, 1764‚Äì1850</em>. Between 1986 and 1994, Marc P√©an, Suzy
Castor, Michel Hector, Gusti-Kara Gaillard, Charles Tardieu-Dehoux,
L√©on Denius Pamphile, Guy Pierre, and Claude B. Augsute (again) won
the prize. In 2015, after a suspension for a variety of reasons, the
history prize resumed in partnership with the Fondation Roger
Gaillard. Since the award‚Äôs return, historians D√©lide Jospeh and
Jean Alix Ren√© won in 2015 and 2017, respectively.¬†<a href="#fnref:15" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
