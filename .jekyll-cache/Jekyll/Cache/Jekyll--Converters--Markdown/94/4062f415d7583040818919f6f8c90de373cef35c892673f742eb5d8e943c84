I"Ù<p>The night of 19 June 2020 marked the conclusion of 40 Nights of the
Voice, a digital wake initiated by Ronald Cummings, Nalini Mohabir, and
Kaie Kellough to commemorate the life and works of historian, poet,
critic, and theorist Edward Kamau Brathwaite, who had transitioned on 4
February 2020. The wake was launched on 11 May, on what would have been
Brathwaite‚Äôs ninetieth birthday, and continued for the next forty
nights. In the inaugural upload, Kellough informed viewers that
participants in the wake‚Äîcreative writers, like himself, and
scholars‚Äîwould be reading from Brathwaite‚Äôs oeuvre, with a different
upload announced each night on Twitter @Kamauremix, along with links to
full videos on YouTube at the Kamau Brathwaite Remix Engine account. The
hashtags #KamauBrathwaite and #40NightsofTheVoice were used to
aggregate and connect posts. The project brought together contributors
from the Caribbean, Canada, the United Kingdom, Africa, and the United
States in what Kelly Baker Josephs, building on Brathwaite‚Äôs work, has
theorized as the ‚Äúdigital yard.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> All the participants were united by
the fact that they had been ‚Äúshaped and guided by Kamau‚Äôs thinking, his
writing and his presence,‚Äù<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and they produced what I am calling an
explicitly Caribbean practice of ‚Äúdigital diasporic elegy.‚Äù</p>

<p>This essay is divided into three sections. The first defines and unpacks
my key term, <em>digital diasporic elegy</em>, and establishes my focus on
texts generated in, by, and about Caribbean diasporic subjects. The
second drops the reader into a moment‚Äîmore specifically, into a moment
in which I trace the digital crumbs of what I read as a digital elegy
involving a Sino-Caribbean diasporic cultural text. The final section
returns to the multiplatform project, 40 Nights of the Voice, a project
readily recognizable as digital, diasporic, and Caribbean, in the hope
that the meditation on digital elegiac practice will enable a more
nuanced understanding of the expressions of mourning and grief and of
the possibilities of consolation they contain.</p>

<p>With roots in classical literature, the term <em>elegy</em> denotes ‚Äúa short
poem, usually formal or ceremonious in tone and diction, occasioned by
the death of [a] person.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Elegiac texts can be textual or
photographic; can take the form of plastic arts, monuments, or
memorials; and can be literal and symbolic. They are at once public and
intensely private, collective and personal, and they are often tied to
the operations of nationalism. They are performative, at times signaling
narcissistic, self-interested, or at the very least self-regarding plays
for immortality. The elegy is a genre of affective expression that
pushes at the limits of language, and strains and exposes its
competencies and inefficiencies.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> In the strictest sense, elegies are
texts that memorialize the dead, frame loss for the living, and,
according to Karen Weisman in her introduction to <em>The Oxford Handbook
of the Elegy</em>, exist ‚Äúbetween the extremes of life and death, joy and
sorrow, the receding past and the swiftly moving present.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Most
important for my analysis, the elegiac genre is defined by the
exigencies and technologies of the historical moment in which the elegy
is produced. I am interested in what constitutes the elegy in our
contemporary moment‚Äîa moment wherein a global pandemic has pushed so
many of us to live much of our lives online, a time also of upheaval and
social unrest, in which the daily news, filled with obscene images of
black death, comes to us via our digital news feeds and timelines. How
do we deal with death, dying, mourning, loss, and grief, both personal
and collective, as we are relentlessly subject to a palpable fatigue
resulting from the ‚Äúalways now-ness‚Äù of our ‚Äúswiftly moving present‚Äù?</p>

<p>Literary theorist Jahan Ramazani claims that the modern elegy is
interested in not so much healing, transcendence, or redemption but
rather immersion. It is the immersive quality of social media that is
relevant for my analysis.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> According to Ramazani, there are two
‚Äúdistinct elements that fuse in the imagery of national elegies,‚Äù
notably, ‚Äúthe collective mourning that is often fundamental in the
formation of group identity‚Äù and the ‚Äúrecursive or echoic quality of
poetic language.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> It is this pattern, repetition, consonance, and
assonance‚Äîthe beats and rhythms of the poetic‚Äîthat creates
interpenetrative effects among participants, community members,
creators, and readers/audiences. Nadia Ellis, however, contests
Ramazani‚Äôs claim that modern elegies do not ‚Äúheal the living.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> In
her ‚ÄúElegies of Diaspora,‚Äù Ellis links loss and pain, two threads
inextricably interwoven into processes of diaspora and migration, to
elegiac texts produced in diaspora, arguing that diasporic elegies
explore the failures and ‚Äúduplicities of the neoliberal state‚Äù and the
pain and grief necessarily attendant to citizenship.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>I use the formulation ‚Äúdigital diasporic elegy‚Äù to describe a set of
contemporary texts, practices, and forms of participation that take up
death, dying, loss, mourning, and lamentation as their subject matter
and circulate among diasporic subjects on social media platforms and
other digital spaces. I am particularly interested in how Caribbean
diasporic subjects struggle with grief and feelings of dislocation as
they navigate violently nationalistic terrains. Social media platforms
are nodal points where subjects in diasporic formations connect and
commune. During this time of global pandemic, people‚Äôs lives have been
constrained to domestic spaces; to venture ‚Äúoutside‚Äù has, for many, been
to go online. Social media engulf users in ever-present grievances.
Databases like YouTube and Instagram use an algorithmic code to bring
‚Äúrecommended‚Äù and ‚Äúof interest‚Äù posts into individual feeds. Producing a
constant stream of imagery, these platforms create a perpetual, painful
present. The mediated present of the news feed is undeniably relentless
and, shaped by the user‚Äôs likes, follows, searches, and susceptibility
to ‚Äúclick bait,‚Äù creates the contours of individual digital personae and
the communities to which they belong. Kelly Baker Josephs offers
insightful critical reflections on a host of online creative activities
in which Caribbean writers engage: tweeting and retweeting, posting and
reposting, and blogging and microblogging on social media sites like
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Leaning on Josephs‚Äôs work, I
analyze YouTube as a digital yard in which Caribbean subjects engage in
and create digital diasporic elegiac practices and texts.</p>

<p>Unlike brick-and-mortar sites that have historically had an elegiac
function as material anchors for nationalistic fantasies, social media
sites like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook can memorialize and
destabilize the privileged relationship between ‚Äúhistory‚Äù and
temporality. Whereas museums and archives create and preserve a version
of the past, social media sites create living and evolving archives of
the now. Further, they allow users to function and envision themselves
as walking archives, impulsively curating often carefully edited and
pixelated, uploadable versions of themselves and their lives.</p>

<p>Social media timelines invoke ‚Äúlinearity‚Äù but are not always faithful to
it. A destabilization of temporality is possible on these platforms
insofar as current and past events can readily merge. While much is made
of the brevity of the ‚Äúnews cycle,‚Äù timelines offer challenges to
cultural and social memory by asynchronously inserting images and videos
of the immediate or recent past alongside images and events from long
ago. As members of particular social circles discover and share cultural
texts anew, the ‚Äúgrievable‚Äù can seem to extend out of the digital ether
to take hold of and traumatize ‚Äúin real time,‚Äù so to speak. Most
recently, the names of black victims of police violence have been
regularly ‚Äúpopping into‚Äù timelines from multiple news media sources and
personal connections. Circulating along with those names are visual
components, elegiac images that can, according to Josh Ellenbogen, in
fact refuse to do the work of conventional elegy. They risk ‚Äú[taking]
us out of a narrative process of grief,‚Äù bringing pain into the present
and inhibiting the ‚Äú‚Äònormal‚Äô work of mourning,‚Äù which is to move
emotionally toward consolation.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Deep ontological wounds are renewed
and reopened as the historical past bleeds into the present through
racialized articulations of power in images of torture, pain, and death.
With no clear beginning, middle, or end, the constant accessibility of
these images and narratives‚Äîthat is, their ‚Äúreach‚Äù‚Äîcan, according to
Elizabeth Helsinger, prolong reflection and extend the duration of
grieving in ways that literary texts, because of specific work done by
visual texts, do not.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The proliferation and dominance of American
popular culture, through global conduits of capital, have done much to
establish a shared conceptual and cultural map, so much so that obscene
images of black death, colored by nationalistic violence and its
intimacies, have provided an arguably global vernacular.</p>

<p>Before 2020, the notion of a virtual wake or funeral was not something
many had considered outside online virtual and gaming communities. Few
had heard of Cemetery.org, the oldest online cemetery and memorial site,
but many had participated in some form of online memorialization,
whether for a loved one, acquaintance, pet, respected colleague, hero,
or even adversary.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> My own Facebook timeline contains shared,
coauthored, and self-authored posts dedicated to Michelle Cliff, V. S.
Naipaul, Toni Morrison, Derek Walcott, Amiri Baraka, Nadine Gordimer,
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Winston Chung Fah, Cheryl A. Wall, Kamau
Brathwaite, and, of course, Prince, among several other literary and
cultural figures. These posts are a part of larger processes of
collective grieving. They become digital nodal points that link (to)
others and work toward the traditional goals of elegiac texts, that of
healing and consolation. In one sense, these texts can be viewed as
twenty-first-century Ozymandius-like digital monuments erected to
appease our age-old preoccupation with railing against
impermanence.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> Yet they are also lamentations connecting diasporic
subjects, and diasporic digital elegy does more than memorialize. It
acknowledges the fluidity of technologies that make these utterances
possible in ways that are linked to the technologies that made diaspora
possible.</p>

<h3 id="always-together-following-the-digital-crumbs-down-the-rabbit-hole">‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù: Following the Digital Crumbs down the Rabbit Hole</h3>

<p>My fall down this particular rabbit hole began around the anniversary of
my mother‚Äôs death, which occurred exactly one year before two planes hit
the twin towers in New York City and arguably changed the literal,
national, and political landscape of the United States. With each
anniversary of this national day of mourning, I am brought back to my
own personal loss. In the process of conducting research for a project
on diasporic Sino-Caribbean subjects and their participation on social
media platforms, I ‚Äúhappened upon‚Äù an upload of ‚ÄúAlways Together,‚Äù a
rocksteady reggae song performed by Byron Lee and the Dragonaires and
featuring vocals by late Taiwanese singer Stephen Cheng. I use the
phrase ‚Äúhappened upon‚Äù somewhat facetiously, knowing that what drops
into my ‚Äúrecommended for you‚Äù feed has been shaped by hundreds of prior
decisions I have made: by my ‚Äúlikes,‚Äù visits, and ‚Äúcookies,‚Äù all the
subterranean code that contours the digital worlds I visit and inhabit.
Encountering this song in my own time of remembrance became an occasion
to think through what constitutes the digital diasporic elegy and how a
participant‚Äôs engagement with a concatenation of visual and aural
signifiers constitutes a digital diasporic elegiac practice.</p>

<p>In the comments section of the upload, I noted an appeal for information
regarding the track posted by an individual with the username Pascal
Cheng. In his post, Cheng claims to be the son of Stephen Cheng and
mentions that he had never known about the track or about his father‚Äôs
experience in Jamaica, nor does he think his father ever knew of the
track‚Äôs classic status.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<p>I had dropped, <em>en media res</em>, onto one of many nodal points Pascal
Cheng created in his search for information about a part of his father‚Äôs
life that had been unknown to him. In following the younger Cheng‚Äôs
digital crumbs, I became witness not just to his interaction with other
users but to an instance of digital elegiac practice. Pascal Cheng‚Äôs
search, with the aid of other YouTube users, took him to official news
media resources like the Jamaica <em>Gleaner</em>, as well as to music
aficionado, crate digger, and commercial sites such as Dub Store
Records.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Users also directed Pascal Cheng to other media and
cultural texts, including <em>The Man with the Iron Fist</em>, a 2012 film
starring and produced by RZA, legendary member and producer of the
hip-hop music group Wu Tang Clan; RZA had included Frances Yip‚Äôs popular
1974 version, ‚ÄúGreen Is the Mountain,‚Äù on the film‚Äôs soundtrack. Pascal
Cheng was also directed to Jeannette Kong‚Äôs <em>Finding Samuel Lowe: From
Harlem to China</em>, a 2014 documentary film about Paula Williams Madison,
a woman of black and Chinese Jamaican descent engaged in an analogous
search for her Chinese grandfather and family.</p>

<p>Rocksteady, the precursor to contemporary reggae and dancehall, with
origins in mento, rhythm and blues, jazz, and ska, had been taken up in
the mid-1960s by the first wave of British skinheads, a youth subculture
that emerged from working-class enclaves of London and whose members
rejected both political conservatism and the bourgeois cathexis to
American-identified ‚Äúhippie‚Äù/pop culture. Several YouTube uploads of
‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù use cover art from Skinheads on the Dancefloor albums
(fig. 3) or use photographic stills of skinheads in England.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<p>In terms of composition, several users have uploaded the track with
static pictures of either a 1967 Sunshine Records or 2018 Federal

growing number have used cover art from the album <em>BMN Ska and

2019 by Dub Store Records, a Japanese record company out of Tokyo (fig.

<p>The BMN collection cover art is a cluster of signifiers. It depicts a
young black man in what looks like a Panama hat and wearing dark
sunglasses, with the shadow of the photographer discernable in the
lenses. He is the embodiment of ‚Äúcool.‚Äù Added to this visual signifier
of ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù is the inclusion of Ronnie Nasralla, named on the
cover as producer. Nasralla, a Jamaican-born record producer of Lebanese
and Jamaican descent, had gone to school with Byron Lee and was part of
an early incarnation of the Dragonaires. The collection had been
recorded in Kingston and distributed by BMN out of Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<p>The upload I had happened upon was not the first under which Pascal
Cheng had made his appeal. By the time he posted his request in the
comments under the video I found, it was clear from his exchange with a
user with the name 1970Rudeboy that he had acquired and was responding
with some knowledge‚Äîa fuller understanding of the multiple national and
music histories of the original Taiwanese track and the one produced in
Jamaica.</p>

<p>Pascal Cheng‚Äôs process of following the digital breadcrumbs is a
dramatic instance of a digital elegiac practice. His public search for
traces of his father can be followed across dozens of YouTube uploads,
in their comments sections and through the hyperlinks users shared to
sites for music aficionados and crate diggers, as well as to Stephen
Cheng‚Äôs 2012 <em>New York Times</em> obituary. Anyone who chooses to can follow
Cheng and acquire these various narratives, one of which is an
understanding of the historical, cultural, and political contexts in
which Stephen Cheng and Byron Lee created the remarkable recording of
‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù that brings together multiple national threads and
histories. For example, on 27 June 2019, YouTube user Mike Aylward
entered the conversation thread begun by Pascal Cheng and 1970RudeBoy to
inform Cheng of the existence of Krish Raghav‚Äôs longform comic
‚ÄúRedemption Songs,‚Äù a graphic historical essay published online in
<em>Topic Magazine</em>.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

<p>‚ÄúRedemption Songs‚Äù begins with the image of an animated record bearing
the title ‚ÄúBeijing Babylon,‚Äù and on the record player arm appears
‚ÄúReggae‚Äôs 60-year Journey to China‚Äù (fig. 8). The essay-comic then
informs the reader of Stephen Cheng and Byron Lee‚Äôs meeting and
recording of ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù and provides a Soundcloud audio file
link. The rest of the essay-comic provides a brief history of the
Chinese in Jamaica and explores the little-known role of Chinese
Jamaicans in Jamaican music production. It goes on to inform the reader
about the dissemination of reggae music in Mainland China through
<em>dakou</em> culture, the black-market sale of surplus unsold Western music
stock. Reggae found an audience in Mainland China through its appeal to
ethnic minorities chafing under oppression and those invested in
political resistance.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> Raghav‚Äôs three-part digital essay-comic ends
with an animated image of Lee and Cheng and these words of lamentation:
‚ÄúStarting from Cheng and Byron Lee in 1967‚Ä¶ / A yearning. / A moment of
freedom. / Of Zion glimpsed.‚Äù Within twenty-four hours of Aylward‚Äôs
YouTube post, Pascal Cheng confirmed having read the essay-comic.</p>

<p>One way to read this graphic historical essay is as a reclamation, a
text that addresses the collective trauma created when the Hakka were
forced from their homeland over 1650 years ago. They were made to endure
four intercontinental migrations before being pushed, in a fifth major
migration, into the Pacific, the Americas, and the Atlantic in search of
economic prosperity, political and religious asylum, and freedom.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>
‚ÄúRedemption Songs‚Äù points to a long labor history linking African,
Caribbean, and Chinese diasporas to networks of (neo)colonial capital,
and it suggests, visually and aurally, collaboration between descendants
of diasporized peoples. Narratively speaking, the essay-comic is more
than a simple digression. I include it to mirror the meandering process
of ‚Äúfalling down the rabbit hole.‚Äù ‚ÄúRedemption Songs‚Äù is a nodal point,
a digital crumb that, in this agglutinative process, provides a more
nuanced understanding of the complex historical forces colluding to
produce the song ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù and its makers.</p>

<p>In 1967 Stephen Cheng, a singer known for mixing Western and Eastern
styles (Cheng was born and raised in China and educated in the United
States), visited Jamaica to perform traditional Chinese folk music.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>
During his short stay, he met Byron Lee, of black and Chinese Jamaican
descent, and they recorded the now classic track with Lee‚Äôs backing
band, the Dragonaires, at Lee‚Äôs Dynamic Sounds Recording Studio.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup>
This meeting and recording took place five years after the 1962
declaration of Jamaica‚Äôs independence and three years after Edward
Seaga, in his capacity as the head of Social Welfare and Economic
Development, had handpicked Lee and the Dragonaires to back the black
performers Jimmy Cliff, Millie Smalls, and Prince Buster as they
represented Jamaica and Jamaican culture at the 1964 New York World‚Äôs
Fair.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> It was just two years after the upheavals of 1965, first when
anti-Chinese riots in Jamaica created a domestic disturbance that
escalated to a week of rioting, violence, and destruction of Chinese
property, and then when the Jamaican government declared a state of
emergency in West Kingston because of political unrest in the form of
proxy battles between the Jamaican Labour Party and the People‚Äôs
National Party. It is against this backdrop of larger debates about
citizenship and national belonging occurring in Jamaica in the 1960s
that the composition and recording of ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù should be
understood.</p>

<p>The recording, ‚Äúcuriously s[u]ng in Chinese,‚Äù brought together two
representatives of Chinese identity with historically vexed
relationships to dominant constructions of Chinese national
identity.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Stephen Cheng, born to a wealthy family in Shanghai in
1923, had been part of an exodus of people who emigrated to the United
States in 1948, shortly before the Nationalist KMT government led by
Chiang Kai-Shek officially came to power. Byron Lee, born in 1935 in
Jamaica, was of black and Hakka Chinese Jamaican descent. The name
<em>Hakka</em>, which literally means ‚Äúguest people,‚Äù had been assigned to a
subset of the Han people when genealogical data was being codified for
imperial purposes fifteen hundred years prior to their migration to the
Caribbean basin in the mid-1800s as indentured workers brought in to
replace recently emancipated Afro-descended laborers. The Hakka are a
fundamentally diasporic people with a history of outsiderness, political
rebellion, and resistance. They were the driving force of one of the
bloodiest uprisings in recorded history, the Taiping Rebellion
(1850‚Äì¬≠64), which sought to end dynastic rule, institute land and
education reform, and topple the Manchurian Qing dynasty.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> People of
Hakka descent were also at the ideological core of the Chinese
Revolution: Chiang Kai-Shek, director-general of the Kuomintang and
ruler of Taiwan as the president of the Republic of China, and
Trinidadian-born Eugene Acham Chen were architects of the Chinese
Revolution. They were pupils of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, along with Mao Zedong,
who became the chairman of the Communist Party of China and leader of
the Peoples Republic of China.</p>

<p>When Lee and his band were chosen by Seaga to perform at the World‚Äôs
Fair, there was public outcry. Lee and the Dragonaires were considered
too ‚Äúuptown‚Äù and not Jamaican enough (i.e., not black enough) to
represent the people.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> At the same time, the choice of Lee and his
racially mixed band signified both Jamaica‚Äôs national motto, ‚ÄúOut of
Many, One People,‚Äù and the long history of Sino-Caribbean participation
in cultural production. Sino-Caribbeans, because of their particular
diasporic history, have participated in Jamaican cultural production as
musicians, producers, sound engineers, and record shop and studio
owners. The history of the Chinese in Jamaica and their relationship to
music production illustrates the historical, political, and economic
forces that made ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù possible.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù is supposedly adapted from a Taiwanese folk song that
emerged from an indigenous ethnic minority in Taiwan, and it was
speculated to have originally been sung, at least partially, in the Alit
dialect. But this ‚Äútruth‚Äù of the song‚Äôs composition is tied to fantasies
of indigeneity and appropriation. The song was actually composed by film
director Chang Cheh (Zhang Che) for his 1949 <em>Storm Cloud over Alishan /
Alishan Fengyun</em>, the first Mandarin-language film produced in
Taiwan.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> Originally titled ‚ÄúGreen Is the High Mountain‚Äù or ‚ÄúGirl
from Alishan,‚Äù it later became a folk standard, appropriated by the very
same ethnic group to whom the song was originally attributed. The lyrics
of the song incorporate familiar conventional signifiers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Green is the high mountain
Blue is the mountain stream
The girl of Ali Mountain is pretty as the water
The youth of Ali Mountain is strong as the mountain
The mountain forever green, the water forever blue
The girl and that youth will never be parted‚Äîlike the blue water flows
around the green mountain<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lyrics deploy traditional romantic metaphors of virile young men and
fecund young women so familiar they do not bear comment, but in the
version produced by Lee and Cheng, these lyrics are sung over a
rocksteady beat. In terms of soundscape, Cheng‚Äôs ‚Äúplaintive warbling‚Äù
laid over this rocksteady beat creates ‚Äúsomething entirely different:
one of the most unlikely fusions ever committed to wax.‚Äù According to
James Baron, ‚ÄúThere is no way it should work, but somehow it does, and
quite brilliantly.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Cheng does not sing in the Hakka dialect, which
would have been the dialect of the Chinese ethnic group that made up
more than 80 percent of the Chinese immigrants to Jamaica, nor in the
Alit dialect of the Tsou people, the indigenous Taiwanese group of the
song‚Äôs supposed origin. Instead, he sings in Mandarin, the dialect that
would be understood in Taiwan and Beijing, the seats of opposing powers
of the Revolution. The composition appropriates and romanticizes
indigeneity and highlights ethnic cultural specificity at a time when
violent debates were being waged by the opponents in the Chinese civil
war (1927‚Äì49) about what it meant to be Chinese.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>

<p>The colonial, imperial, and national forces that created Byron Lee and
the Dragonaires and Stephen Cheng are not the same. Lee was part of an
‚Äúalways already‚Äù diasporic people able to move into microbusinesses as
the result of generations-old established conduits of skilled trades and
industry. Cheng, whose family ‚Äúlost everything‚Äù in the Chinese civil
war, immigrated to the United States, was educated at Julliard and
Columbia University, and eventually moved to Canada with his French
Canadian wife. Both Lee and Cheng were known for blending musical
genres, and both performers represent diasporic groups who struggled
with national belonging and historical (in)visibility. The song‚Äôs title
ironically evokes a coherent Chinese identity that is destabilized by
the fact of diaspora. In doing so, ‚ÄúAlways Together,‚Äù enacts griefs
attendant to the diasporic subject‚Äôs struggle with inherently violent
nationalisms and that subject‚Äôs vexed relationships to citizenship. It
also speaks to the difficulties of belonging consistent with Nadia
Ellis‚Äôs formulation of the diasporic elegy‚Äôs ability to articulate the
‚Äúsimultaneous apprehension of long-past and all-too-fresh
violence.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> In the case of Lee, it is his not being Jamaican enough
to fully belong to and represent the nation. For Cheng, it is the loss
of home during a time of civil war, the subsequent remove to America,
and feelings of dislocation compounded by his attending two of the
arguably top institutions in America for music and education but still
being relegated to ‚Äúethnic performances‚Äù because of North American
racism and stereotypes. Lee and Cheng are ‚Äútogether,‚Äù in terms of both
being Chinese diasporic subjects, and the ‚Äúalways‚Äù in the song‚Äôs title
can be read as suggesting a perpetuity to their diasporic condition.</p>

<p>The various uploads of ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù are not, for the most part,
cultural texts created explicitly for the platform.<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> In and of
themselves, these texts are not elegiac. However, Pascal Cheng‚Äôs process
of searching, learning, and interacting with other users to gain
knowledge of his father very much is. The activities in the digital yard
surrounding this Caribbean cultural text are made possible by the
underlying code of the platform that enables creative interaction and
data/file storage.</p>

<p>When cultural studies folks talk about the digital, they do not
necessarily talk about code, that mysterious ‚Äústuff‚Äù that
operationalizes language‚Äîthat ‚Äústuff‚Äù that ultimately is akin to the
deep structure, grammar and syntax, and symbolism and signifiers that
make all forms of linguistic communication possible.<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> The
relationship of poetry to code is not necessarily obvious. Sandy
Baldwin, reading inversely from code to poetry, claims that ‚Äúpoetry
works like the doubleness of code (as something to be read and something
to be performed).‚Äù<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> It is the deep structure, and the messiness
within that structure, that creates connection and produces meaning, and
messy code is not necessarily code that does not work.<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> Similar to
poetic form, what looks like an anomaly or deviation in form may in fact
be an alternative way of thinking about the symbolic connections created
when language is operationalized. The underlying code makes traversing
digital space possible, allows users to move from one nodal point to
another, and brings together material and immaterial, digital and analog
technologies. It is this deep structural code that links together
uploads associated with ‚ÄúAlways Together,‚Äù as well as linking them to
clips such as ‚ÄúChinese Rocksteady,‚Äù a video captured on a cell phone in
which musician and producer Clive Chin‚Äîeldest son of Vincent ‚ÄúRandy‚Äù and
Pat Chin, founders of VP Records and Randy‚Äôs Studio 17‚Äîis seen and heard
playing ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù in his capacity as ‚Äúselector‚Äù (MC [master of
ceremonies] and arbiter of musical selections) at the Shelter, an
underground club in Shanghai.<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup></p>

<p>In the clip, uploaded 30 November 2010, the dub music pioneer Chin tells
the enthusiastic crowd that in playing this ‚Äúbeautiful chune‚Äù he is
fulfilling a promise made a year prior, and that the crowd may be able
to understand the song because of the dialect in which it is sung. The
Shelter, located in the French Concession, is in the part of Shanghai
where Stephen Cheng was born. Eight years after the initial upload, a
user by the name of JujuBean claimed to be the grandchild of Stephen
Cheng and asked for information about the upload; in fact, Pascal Cheng
is JujuBean‚Äôs father. The search for knowledge, history, connection,
and, potentially, community and consolation has now been taken up by the
next generation. I read Pascal Cheng‚Äôs efforts as a practice of
unraveling diasporic threads.</p>

<p>There is an element of pleasure in the dive down the rabbit hole and in
discovering and exploring the affective ligaments/code connecting me to
Pascal Cheng‚Äôs search for his father. I fell into this process, allowed
myself to meander, to feel frustration and disappointment when links
failed or were broken, and to be happy when I realized that JujuBean had
taken up the search for their ancestor. I continue to question what it
means to be bereft in this historical moment, what it means to explore
in this manner, courtesy of the algorithmic code that links us on and to
digital platforms, and I read the digital yard as providing a space for
creation, invention, and expression‚Äîa space in which grief, as Judith
Butler argues, is not privatized but ‚Äúexposes the constitutive sociality
of the self, a basis for thinking a political community of a complex
order.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:37" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">37</a></sup> I have defined digital diasporic elegiac process as an
agglutinative and interactive one, linking texts, practices, and
participation of diasporic subjects across social media platforms in the
‚Äúdigital yard‚Äù to address themes of death, dying, loss, mourning, and
lamentation. I would like to now turn to a cultural text that is
explicitly a digital diasporic elegy.</p>

<h2 id="40nightsofthevoice">#40NightsofTheVoice</h2>

<p>I conclude with a return to a cultural text created for the digital yard
that is immediately identifiable as a digital diasporic elegy, 40 Nights
of the Voice. I make this turn to distinguish between elegiac process
and elegiac objects. The organizers‚Äô elegiac mission was made explicit
when they announced, ‚ÄúWe hope that this collective celebration will
serve both as commemoration of [Brathwaite‚Äôs] legacy and a way to
commune together during this time of quarantine.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:38" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> It began with
thirteen poets and scholars reading Brathwaite‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúWake.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:39" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup></p>

<p>That a born-digital elegy would be created in honor of Brathwaite seems
almost inevitable, given Brathwaite‚Äôs techne in creating his ‚ÄúSycorax
Video Style.‚Äù Brathwaite‚Äôs personal digital elegiac practice coheres in
his ‚Äútime of salt,‚Äù a culmination of three traumatic events: the death
of Doris, his first wife and bibliographer; the destruction of his home,
including his Library of Alexander, by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988; and a
home invasion in which a gun was held to his head, the trigger pulled,
and the empty chamber lodged a symbolic bullet in his head. Unable to
access computer files on his recently deceased wife‚Äôs Apple Mac SE30,
Brathwaite experimented with the technology available to him as he
struggled to express his grief. Through this tussle with language that
seemed insufficient to the purpose, Brathwaite found, in the tension
between analog and digital, an alternative aesthetic language that took
the <em>para</em> out of <em>paratextual</em>. He experimented with alternating fonts,
sizes, leading, and images achievable through the Mac and Stylewriter
printer. Once we consider the navigational code, the computational
infrastructure that links keystroke to lighted image(s) on the screen,
the underlying keywords and syntax that make up the programming code
that links desktop computer to printer, and the (im)material magic he
perceived therein, then Brathwaite becomes the architect of digital
diasporic elegy in its inchoate form.</p>

<p>Ultimately, and unsurprisingly, the 40 Nights of the Voice project could
not be contained by the spatiotemporal parameters the organizers
originally set. It had to respond to the exigencies of the moment, which
meant in some cases the doubling up of posts; missing a day because of a
social-media blackout protest; and unexpected participant choices,
decisions, and technologies that effected the length, composition,
style, and so on of the contributions. The mise-en-sc√®ne of many uploads
strike familiar notes in terms of the ‚Äútalking head.‚Äù There is the
positioning of the reader: most centered, some off center. Many are
framed by stacks of books. Some are more theatrical; some are more
musical. Others still are more ‚Äúacademic,‚Äù offering prefatory remarks,
situating the reading in the context of Brathwaite‚Äôs oeuvre, situating
themselves in relation to the reading, situating themselves in relation
to the man. Several chose to read from Brathwaite‚Äôs considerable body of
elegiac poems. Some offered something more personal‚Äîa memory of their
first encounter with the man, their first encounter with his work, and
so on. Each upload is now a point along a digital archipelago that
invokes structures of mediation between the analog and the digital,
codes and subcodes.</p>

<p>The digital yard is a site of creation and community. It is a
restorative space in which the traditional rites of mourning we have
been denied in our contemporary moment can take shape anew in the
context of a complex system‚Äîone that does not have simple discursive
explanations, that cannot be explained by simple or explicit
equations.<sup id="fnref:40" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">40</a></sup> What links the 40 Nights of the Voice project and the
uploads of ‚ÄúAlways Together‚Äù is the platform, the yard, and the
computational infrastructure that makes expression, movement, and
connection possible between digital objects and participants. I propose
here that there is a Caribbean digital diasporic elegiac practice that
embraces the subterranean codes and networks that transform the
platform‚Äîthe yard‚Äîinto a site of generative mourning and healing.</p>

      <p>According to Crate Digging Cooperative Records, the term <em>crate
digger</em> originates in hip-hop culture, specifically with the DJ
practice of utilizing literal milk crates to transport and store
vinyl records. ‚ÄúCrate digging‚Äù is the active, physical, often
voracious scouring of record stores in search for vinyl records ‚Äúto
sample.‚Äù More recently, the term has loosened to include internet
searches, digital downloads, video watching, and any activity that
allows you to engage in a ‚Äúself discovery of music.‚Äù rchecka, ‚ÄúCrate

      <p>Hong Xiuquan, leader of the Taiping Rebellion, was of Hakka
descent. This war between the Taipings and the Manchu-led Qing
Dynasty, which sought to dismantle the dynastic social and political
order, resulted in the deaths of 20‚Äì70 million and the displacement
of millions more. The uprising sought to expel foreign political and
economic interests, suppress private trade, institute socialized
land reform, ensure that education included women, and stop foot
binding. It is seen as the ideological forerunner to the Chinese
civil war.¬†<a href="#fnref:25" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>I use the term <em>operationalize</em> to convey and retain for the
reader the relationship between a given word and its function in the
deep structure of both poetics and code. Code is a language
understood by computers. It is not a ‚Äúnatural language‚Äù per se,
despite human language being the symbolic system used to create it.
Human language has to be converted into a set of ‚Äúwords‚Äù that the
computer will understand. The keywords are akin to verbs. Verbs
describe or indicate action, and keywords initiate action. An
arrangement of keywords for successful execution of a desired
computation (or computational task) is referred to as <em>syntax</em>, and
when a set of keywords is put together with syntax, the result is a
programming language.¬†<a href="#fnref:33" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>In fielding a question about the difference between clean and
messy code, Daniel Super claims that the key difference is
‚Äúcomprehensibility‚Äù: ‚ÄúYou can understand clean code when you read
it. It has meaningful variable and function names¬† The
responsibilities are separated out into discrete pieces. The methods
are organized in a manner that makes sense, with related
functionality grouped together. It has comments that actually help
you understand what‚Äôs happening. You can make sense of it. You don‚Äôt
have to read through it ten times and struggle to make sense of what
the person who wrote it was trying to do. Clean code is code that
someone else, other than the person who wrote it[,] could maintain
without wanting to strangle you and feed your corpse into a wood
