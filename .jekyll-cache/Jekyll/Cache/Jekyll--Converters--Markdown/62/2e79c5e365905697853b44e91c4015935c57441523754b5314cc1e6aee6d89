I"á<p>This article discusses the digitization of the historic newspaperÂ the <em>Barbados Mercury Gazette</em> (1783â€“1848) and its potential for historical research and teaching. The newspaper sheds light on every aspect of life in a dystopian colonial reality. The digitization of the gazette is a beginning, rather than a "finished product." The aim of the project is not simply to facilitate reading the gazette in a digital format; if so, then digitization would risk reproducing and re-inscribing inequalities, silences, and exclusions. The aim is to engage users, particularly Barbadians, in researching their enslaved ancestors. At the same time, the article reflects on the meaning of digitization in postcolonial settings in the global South and the challenges arising at the intersection of access and conservation. While digitization is promoted as digital preservation, it cannot save what is not accounted for, what is not described properly, and what has not been documented.</p>
