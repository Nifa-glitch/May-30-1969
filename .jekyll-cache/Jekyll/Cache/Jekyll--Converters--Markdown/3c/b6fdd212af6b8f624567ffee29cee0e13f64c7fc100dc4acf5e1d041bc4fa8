I"‹<p>In the last fifteen years or so, the story of JosÃ© Antonio Aponteâ€”the free black carpenter and artist who attempted to lead a major antislavery revolution in early-nineteenth-century Havanaâ€”has drawn the animated attention of scholars in history, art history, literary criticism, and anthropology, among other fields. Most of that scholarship has utilized time-worn techniques of scholarly practice: rigorous and wide-ranging archival research, perceptive close readings of judicial testimony, forays into theoretical works as interpretive aids to analysis. This essay revisits the story of Aponte, relying on the digital humanities website <em>Digital Aponte</em> that weâ€”Linda RodrÃ­guez, in collaboration with Ada Ferrerâ€”curated. <em>Digital Aponte</em> invites an interdisciplinary collaboration that can be said to echo the collaborative approaches Aponte himself pursued in his creative, intellectual, and political practices. In the present, such approaches advance our understandings of Aponte and the histories of black antislavery in the Atlantic world, just as they foreground the profound link between artistic and revolutionary work.</p>
