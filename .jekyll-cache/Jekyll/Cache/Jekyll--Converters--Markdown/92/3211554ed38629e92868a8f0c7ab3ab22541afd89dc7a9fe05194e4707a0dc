<p>A dyad of satellite images of Puerto Rico at night were taken by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and sent out as a tweet.
The top image was taken at 2:00 a.m. on 24 July 2017. The bottom image
was taken at 2:00 a.m. on 25 September 2017. Although only months apart,
the contrast between the two is stark. The second image was taken five
days after Hurricane Mar√≠a made landfall in Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>Pictured here, Puerto Rico is a dark mass, spots of light like stars
plotting colonial and indigenous space and time. Ghostly white dots
congeal around the cities of San Juan and Ponc√©, named after noble
Spanish bloodlines and conquerors. To a lesser extent, the same pattern
outlines the cities of Mayagu√´z and Arecibo, whose names, in contrast,
index ancient caciques and indigenous genealogies. Once upon a time a
slaveholding colony, San Juan was filled with traders who met merchant
ships from across the Americas, exchanging human cargo for plantation
and farm products harvested elsewhere on the island. Ponc√© and Mayagu√´z
were lands of sugar and slavery, but even smaller municipalities like
Arecibo were dotted by farms and bore witness to anticolonial resistance
waged by peasants and small landowners as well as enslaved and free
laborers of African and Native descent.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Before emancipation in 1873,
enslaved women, children, and men of African descent would have filled
those spaces and the other black, black spaces on the map. Some Africans
would have absconded as maroons to those darkened mountains together in
search of fugitive <em>palenques</em>. Others may have arrived in the interior,
having been kidnapped from plantation districts and sold to cash-poor
farmers who could not afford the prices in specie being demanded by
international slave-trading merchants.</p>

<p>Human catastrophe leaves a mark, a black spot in time and space. On 20
September 2017, when Hurricane Mar√≠a made landfall on the island, the
site of Christopher Columbus‚Äôs second so-called discovery and the
birthplace of the New World, it swept bridges off their supports, tore
leaves off the trees in the rainforest, drove wildlife into migration or
into hiding. The electrical grid, already a battered, colonial
infrastructure, fell to pieces, as did the water and sewage systems and
other public services. San Juan, the capital, <em>el santo</em>, the herald of
Spanish empire, bowed and flailed in Guabancex‚Äôs onslaught until,
finally, darkness reigned.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But blackness in the blackened spaces hit hardest by Hurricane Mar√≠a
disappeared in the aftermath. In Carolina and Lo√≠za, towns in the
constellation near San Juan, that some one-fifth to three-quarters of
the population (respectively) described itself as of African descent
went without mention in the aftermath of the storm. In Ponc√©, which did
not restore electricity to all its residents until August 2018‚Äî328 days
after the storm‚Äîbetween 10 and 20 percent described themselves as
black.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Indigenous spaces suffered similar disappearances. Utuado,
which for generations claimed indigenous patrimony on the island and is
the home of Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park, barely rated a mention
in mainstream news generated by the storm. Nor does Utuado, a region
where even before the storm running water and electricity were
privileges not rights, appear in the satellite image. ‚ÄúMemory,‚Äù poet
Natasha Trethaway writes, ‚Äúdulls the lash / for the master, sharpens it
for the slave.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> And few cared to remember that the chronic
dispossession faced by black and indigenous spaces on the island would
leave them most vulnerable and most in need after the storm.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>At the same time, somatic blackness and nonwhiteness saturated screens
and devices as images of Puerto Ricans suffering under palm trees
appeared on televisions and computers, spread by mainstream media.
Blackness appeared in other ways as well, somewhere underneath the
biopolitical and ocular. Tapping into a lexicon of Caribbean women,
children, and men as both childlike and bestial, President Donald Trump
derisively threw paper towels at relief workers on his visit to the
island, treating them in the words of one observer, ‚Äúlike dogs.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> On
the island itself, the federal and local police-military-surveillance
apparatus that preoccupied itself with the war on drugs justified
harassment of black islanders, shifted after the storm. Police wasted no
time implementing and enforcing a curfew, including breaking up
gathering spaces of dance and play‚Äîthe kind that inevitably erupt when
there is one working generator in a neighborhood and the night is long,
hot, and dark. And in breaking news about the storm‚Äôs impact, social
media queries circulated desperately and especially among Puerto Ricans
in the United States searching for incommunicado kin; blackness appeared
in the loss and mourning of a diaspora for its people‚Äîfor those lost
beneath the sea.</p>

<p>Like Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Mar√≠a was a natural disaster only to
the extent that the Caribbean is no stranger to storms. The indigenous
population of Puerto Rico had even named a deity after the hurricane:
Guabancex, a femme supernatural entity of such power and importance that
she was accompanied by two lesser deities as her heralds and commanders.
However, ecological damage wrought by human interference has caused a
climate catastrophe so disruptive that 2017 became the first hurricane
season on record to witness the formation of three hurricanes at
Category 3 or higher. Failure to invest in environmental resources or
basic infrastructure exacerbated the impact of the storm upon landfall.
And as a result of focused neglect at all levels of governance,
including by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the thirty-four
people killed in the storm itself would be joined by over one thousand
others as life-support systems failed, refrigerators used to store
medical necessities like insulin and baby formula grew warm, and
residents resorted to suicide to secure relief from trauma.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>
Guabancex, when she ‚Äúgrows angry,‚Äù writes Fray Ramon Pan√©, ‚Äúmoves the
wind and water and tears down the houses and uproots the trees.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The black space on the map of Puerto Rico after the storm offers more
than a referendum on an environmental event. It surfaces, in atmospheric
and visual form, our failure to contend with slavery‚Äôs past and empire‚Äôs
present. This failure erupted in full hurricane force across the
Caribbean as the archipelago paid the price of generations of extractive
violence. And yet blackness as density of life is still there.
Illuminated or not, it occupies the dark swathes on the map; it
continues to refuse and be refused illumination. It is the null value in
all our humanities. At the crossroads somewhere between state-sanctioned
death and dances on generators, there is a black diasporic technology
that charts a path through the dark. Black diasporic theorists have been
building this technology over a decade of fantastic scholarship. Black
diasporic artists such as Matana Roberts have embodied the experience of
this technology in ethereal music that screams with ghosts. Exploring
what digital and analog landscapes hide and reveal, seeing them in their
fullness after the storm of 1441/1492, finding black space on the map
that does not conclude in black death, requires exploring with a xroads
praxis.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="part-1--code">Part 1. <!---Black---> Code</h2>

<p>Confronting the Suomi image of black space in Puerto Rico brings to mind
another image. In 2012, digital humanist Ben Schmidt created a data
visualization of all the voyages in the US Maury collection. The Maury
collection, eighty-eight microfilmed reels of historical ships‚Äô weather
logs produced between 1784 and 1863, became part of the International
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set in 2002. Schmidt‚Äôs image tracks
all the voyages in black, plotted on a white background of vacated of
land masses.</p>

<p>Schmidt sought to visualize the wind currents that swept caravans of
wood and flesh back and forth across the ocean. Struck by this image,
scholar Marisa Parham troubled this reflection. ‚ÄúAir is energy,‚Äù she
writes. ‚ÄúWhen away from the sea we seldom think about such things
because we seldom connect breeze to wind to storm, until we must
remember what happens when it fuels itself: gales, hurricanes, typhoons,
tornadoes.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>In both the image of a darkened Puerto Rico and that of dark lines of
ships crossing the ocean in the nineteenth century, the viewer faces a
dilemma. On the one hand, the confrontation is with the blackened space
made possible through the use of technology. On the other, the viewer
contends with the use of white space that has been emptied of life, even
as it was epistemologically called in to do the work of outlining the
New World. Obliterated are the bound and blackened bodies that occupy,
produce, and reproduce in the wake of colonial intervention. In the
words of Christina Sharpe, on wake work, ‚ÄúIn the wake, the past that is
not past reappears, always, to rupture the present.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Keeping the
past and present in hand, invoking the wake means visualizing the wave
pattern left behind in the wake of ships passing. It means visualizing
many crossings and crossroads‚Äîships bearing dark-skinned refugees forced
to flee their homes in one direction, ships from the global North
bringing aid to a global South made disastrous by globalization and
neoliberal devastation in the other. Use of the wake also gestures to
the vernacular of ‚Äúwokeness,‚Äù a common twenty-first-century black
diasporic invocation of political awareness of injustice. It means
visualizing all of these as true all at once.</p>

<p>Because these bodies and processes do not appear, whether in the data
sets or seen from space, it becomes difficult to place these images in
relation, but in so many ways they are. Some twenty-seven thousand
enslaved people traveled on ships riding those currents, arriving as
early as 1520 and as late as 1859. Nearly a century ago, the Jones Act,
in true mercantilist-colonialist form, limited shipping to the island of
Puerto Rico to US ships.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> Despite calls by elected officials across
the political spectrum to suspend the act and allow aid to reach
survivors of Hurricane Mar√≠a by any means necessary, conversations
abounded on the act for days before the resident waived it. Even these
facts, as residue of slave ship manifests and government decrees, do not
evidence the undocumented ships and shipping, lives and communities,
linked by wind and water to the island.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>As a result, visibility offers little relief. On the other side of
disappearing, for black and blackened subjects, lies the overindexed,
overexposed voyeurism that accompanies images of death and destruction
in places that look like Puerto Rico (or Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, and
beyond). The West‚Äôs tropic and trope-ic desire for blackened flesh fed
European men for years through the writings of Moreau de St. Mery,
Edward Long, Agostino Brunias, Jean-Baptiste Labat, John Stedman, and
Michel Adanson, to name a few. Moving at the speed of the digital,
mainstream media, non-governmental organizations, police and military
units, fiction and travel writers continue to render the islands, towns,
and regions of the global South spaces of paradise and tourism, illicit
desires and illegal release. In other words, visualizing blackness alone
does its own damage to black humanity. It coughed up former president
George W. H. Bush‚Äôs lurid laughter in a September 2005 press conference
on Hurricane Katrina, when he described New Orleans as a town where he
used ‚Äúto enjoy myself, occasionally too much.‚Äù It excreted from
President Trump‚Äôs statement that Haitian and African migrants to the
United States were coming from ‚Äúshithole countries.‚Äù These imperial
discharges, tinged in white masculine voyeurism, claim to visualize
blackness. But these men consume only black bodies, not black life.</p>

<p>In other words, illuminating digital lanterns with more and more data
does not provide new answers. As scholar Simone Browne has explored, is
a black person with a lantern a cyborg? In 1712, two dozen enslaved
Africans armed themselves and gathered in the city of New York.
Buildings went up in flames. The mathematics of black resistance during
the period of slavery often added up to this‚Äîa handful of white lives
lost, a morass of black life extinguished, and a series of punitive
legal and surveillance measures instituted. New York‚Äôs slave revolt
proved no exception. Ten white residents lost their lives. In
retaliation, mobs attacked enslaved and free black residents of the
town. Police arrested some seventy, others were assaulted in the deluge.
Twenty-three were killed. Of those arrested, twenty-five were sentenced
to death. In March 1713, in the wake of the event, officials instituted
the Lantern Laws: no people of African descent, free or slave, or those
described as ‚ÄúIndians,‚Äù over the age of fourteen could be out at night
without a light, a lantern, or torch of some kind, unless in the company
of a white person. The punishment was forty lashes.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Laws like these encoded ocularity, visuality, illumination, and data
collection as tools of power over black humanity for generations. The
New York Lantern Laws demanded a mechanization of black being. A forced
illumination. An exposure and an outing. In the presumed visibility cast
by the lantern‚Äôs glow, slaveowners received a false sense of safety and
a skewed biometric of what people of African descent look like in the
dark. Blackness indexed by empire loads deviance/death/devastation.
Where the code ignores blackness, it allows white space on the map to do
the work of analysis. But where the code reveals blackness, it does so
at the risk of replicating systems of consumption and restraint.</p>

<p>In ‚ÄúBlack Code Studies,‚Äù a special issue of <em>The Black Scholar</em>, Lauren
Cramer and Alessandra Raengo write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To parse the issue of ‚Äúblack codes,‚Äù it may be worth distinguishing
between the black codes understood as the antiblack assemblages that
have already been written and continue to define encounters with
blackness, and the careful iterative work of blackness writing its own
commands within its existing constraints, which we will call ‚Äúblack
coding.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking Cramer and Raengo‚Äôs distinction seriously, Lantern Laws, the
Jones Act, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the prison warden, the
plantation overseer, or the barracoon provide containers for code work,
but the wake work of attending to black life precedes and proceeds in
the thick of these.</p>

<p>Africans, by their very existence and through outright resistance and
transgression, defied the commodification they had been put to. Those
writing slave codes passed the laws for the purpose of constructing and
maintaining slavery. Africans had their own idea of how their lives
should matter and to whom they were accountable. Where black life
remained in the shadow, where slaves gathered out of sight to plot their
next act of life and resistance, black life transgressed slave codes and
exceeded the register. Even in plain sight, black people who carried
their own lanterns were not simply following the rules. They were
masking, and the light was their mask.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-blacktheory">Part 2. #BlackTheory</h2>

<p>Excavating black life from the crossroads of death and forced
illumination is an ethical project. Histories of slavery offer one
corrective and a vantage point for a new kind of accountability. Studies
of slavery have been suffused with the drive for data. Historians of
slavery were some of the first to take up computational and digital
forms in an attempt to organize knowledge about bondage, the plantation
complex, and the structure of African-descended life in the New World.
In 1998, David Eltis and David Richardson‚Äôs <em>Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade
Database</em>, which launched a database containing almost thirty thousand
Atlantic slave trade voyages, was just one of several databases and
digital projects that emerged at the beginning of this century. In 2000,
Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, partnering with Paul Lachance and Virginia Meacham
Gould, among others, launched the <em>Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy</em>
database. A more recent spate of interest in slavery and the digital
humanities led to the creation of new database projects. In 2012,
<em>Enslaved: People of the Historic Slave Trade</em> (formerly the <em>Slave
Biographies Database</em>), a project led by Walter Hawthorne and Dean
Rehberger, was launched by MATRIX: The Center for Digital Humanities and
Social Sciences at Michigan State University. In 2015, Henry Lovejoy led
a team in databasing records of ‚ÄúLiberated Africans‚Äù or Africans
captured from slave ships by the British after 1808. In 2016, <em>Freedom
on the Move</em>, a project compiling runaway slave ads and led by Edward
Baptist and William C. Block, with team members Vanessa Holden, Mary
Niall Mitchell, Joshua Rothman, and more, launched at Cornell
University. In 2018, the <em>Trans-Atlantic Slave Voyages Database</em> project
partnered with the <em>Inter-American Slave Trade Database</em> project,
expanding the number of searchable slave trade voyages into the
Americas. These projects apply historical methods and digital tools to
the explication of black life under bondage. They each offer rich
archives of data on black life under slavery and place numbers, graphs,
tables, and, in some instances, written texts into a digital realm where
users can access them without traveling to an archive or sitting in a
university classroom.</p>

<p>Black studies scholars, creatives, and activists have also modeled
explicit ways of attending to black humanity in the face of illuminating
technology.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> In 2000, Abdul Alkhalimat launched eBlackStudies with
the goal of bringing black studies, history, and issues of social
justice, particularly around the Black Power movement, into the digital
realm. In 2005, Howard Dodson and Sylviane Diouf completed work on a
massive digital project and presence hosted at the Schomburg Center for
Research in Black Culture titled <em>In Motion: The African American
Migration Experience</em>. Scholars such as Alondra Nelson, Moya Bailey,
Aleia Brown, and Joshua Crutchfield created digital communities that
centered blackness and included creatives and thought producers invested
in radical black futures and social justice, including attending to
trans* and queer of color livelihoods. Others, such as Kim Gallon,
Angel David Nieves, Nishani Frazier, and Christy Hyman, have created
productive communities of digital humanities scholars invested in black
studies within the academy but attuned to the needs of those beyond the
Ivory Tower walls. These projects model the work black digital practice
makes possible. Black digital practice exceeds the academy, defying
boundaries between institution and community, form and function.</p>

<p>Excavating black life from the null value requires digital humanists to
understand the wide range of labor and creativity developed under the
heading ‚Äúthe digital.‚Äù This work can be divided into at least four
forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Digital Humanities: digital humanities within academia</li>
  <li>digital humanities: humanities work rendered digitally</li>
  <li>Digital Media: content created online</li>
  <li>digital practice: üíãüí©üòéüï∑üí¶</li>
</ul>

<p>The fourth form, digital practice, embraces the locus of hybrid,
playful, fluid, and meta possibilities that the digital creates and
problematizes. When hybrid practitioners engage in a <em>black</em> digital
practice, they expose the ‚Äúqueer, femme, fugitive, and radical‚Äù
possibilities of exceeding the field, breaking the CSV, and excavating
life from null values.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Black digital practice builds on methods,
research ethics from theoretical frameworks, research methodologies, and
narrative structures (in short, #BlackTheory) developed in Black
studies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blues epistemology | Woods</li>
  <li>wake work | Sharpe</li>
  <li>dark sousveillance | Browne</li>
  <li>disruption poetics | Morgan</li>
  <li>along the bias grain | Fuentes</li>
  <li>hauntings | Parham</li>
  <li>digital ethics | Bailey</li>
  <li>Man1 and Man2 | Wynter</li>
  <li>critical fabulation | Hartman</li>
  <li>undercommons | Harney and Moten</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶and more</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes this rich and deep intellectual work so powerful is the way
it challenges the container of West and Western thought. #BlackTheory
holds space for black life to be seen without the rancor of the voyeur,
appreciated without the demand for consumption. #BlackTheory remakes
the archive, the human, the land itself. The intellectual projects
outlined above offer only a handful of the reading practices and
strategies necessary for intervening in the replication of black death
in our texts, on device screens, and in our everyday engagement with
academic work (‚ÄúDigital Humanities‚Äù). They demand a practice of either
writing a ‚Äúhistory of the present,‚Äù as Marisa Fuentes and Saidiya
Hartman have espoused; reorganizing the past, as Jennifer Morgan and
Clyde Woods challenge; or creating community and art that transgresses,
as Moya Bailey, Stefano Harney, and Fred Moten have done.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Xroads praxis builds from and with this work. The digital humanities
exists in the wake of, and indexes an astronomical devaluation of, life.
Historians of slavery have a charge to produce truths about the course
of that devaluation. #BlackTheory provides a language for translating
those truths into tools that remake the New World. A xroads praxis does
not demand that these goals intersect so much as that they challenge
users, creators, researchers, and teachers to move in multidimensional
time and space between our disciplines, communities, and institutions. A
xroads praxis requires us to learn from the black feminist
metaphysicians who, as Alexis Pauline Gumbs has related, ‚Äúknew the body
would never be enough.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Xroads praxis evokes African diasporic intellectual and cultural
production, where the crossroads plays a central role in systems of
belief, cosmology, history, and social life. The crossroads is where,
according to diasporic Yoruba practices and beliefs, Elegua or Papa
Legba grants the humble petitioner-practitioner access to spirit world.
The crossroads is linked, at times, to the Bakongo cosmogram, brought
with enslaved Africans to the Americas and representing four temporal
elements (dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight).<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> It is the symbol found
at enslaved burial sites, carved into headstones and stones, or created
by enslaved and free blacks who left artifacts marking the points of the
cross at the four corners of their homes, as occurred in households from
Annapolis, Maryland, to the Bahamas. Throughout the eighteenth century
and into the nineteenth, before the institutionalization of prisons, the
crossroads was where those convicted of crimes were beaten, flogged, or
executed. After execution, the bodies of enslaved Africans; indigenous
women, children, and men; and poor whites were often left at crossroads
across the Caribbean and the South, displayed as lurid warning against
future infraction. At the crossroads, the devil met heroes and fools,
those in the wrong and those wronged. It was where Robert Johnson,
famous blues musician, made his deal with the devil, giving up his soul
for supernatural musical ability.</p>

<p>The crossroads continues to be of contemporary cultural relevance to
black people around the world. In hip-hop artist Common‚Äôs video for
‚ÄúBlack America, Again,‚Äù a cosmogram was painted on the ground in front
of Gilmor Homes, Freddie Gray‚Äôs neighborhood. It was sculpted into the
floor of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture by artist
Houston Conwill. It was where black women wait for justice in Kimberl√©
Crenshaw‚Äôs theory of intersectionality. The crossroads is, in short,
where worlds come together and break apart, good and evil meet to make
deals, utter desperation meets otherworldly possibility, and spirit
meets flesh, where a choice must be made but perhaps not just yet. It is
the quiet before the beat drops.</p>

<p>By describing the collaboration between histories of slavery, the
digital humanities, and #BlackTheory as requiring a xroads praxis, I am
demanding that scholars create data without losing affect, sensation,
and kinship as a framing for black life. Xroads praxis, for instance,
requires heated participation rooted in queerness, corporeality, and
desire. A xroads praxis self-consciously deals in dead things. Slave
manifests. Eighteenth-century testaments. Woodcut headers on ads for
recalcitrant runaways. Myspace posts. Livejournal graphics. 140
characters that disappear after ten days. In a xroads praxis, black life
is no longer invisible, although it may retain a redacted/unknown
quantity (X). It does not shy away from ephemerality. Instead of finding
limits in the absence, xroads praxis uses silence as Maroon code, allows
absconded figures, bodies in freedom, to offer a practicum on what, how,
and who our digital selves could be if we dared to embrace the sensorium
of hauntings left behind.</p>

<p>The second track of Matana Roberts‚Äôs <em>Coin Coin Chapter One: Gens de
couleur libres</em> is titled ‚ÄúPov Piti.‚Äù <em>Pov Piti</em> means ‚Äúpoor little one‚Äù
in Creole/Kreyol.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> ‚ÄúPov Piti‚Äù is the title of a Creole folksong
found along the Gulf Coast, most often referring to a woman who has lost
the love of her life. Sometimes this woman is Lolotte; more often she is
Mamzelle Zizi. One of the most cited versions of Mamzelle Zizi may be
found in Louisiana Creole in Lyle Saxon‚Äôs 1945 <em>Gumbo Ya-Ya: Folk Tales
of Louisiana</em>. Saxon, chronicler of Louisiana and New Orleans folklore
and director of the Louisiana branch of the Federal Writers‚Äô Project

<p>In 1956, Adelaide van Wey sang an updated version, released by
Smithsonian Folkways under the title ‚ÄúPauv‚Äô Piti‚Äô Mom‚Äôzelle Zizi.‚Äù A
folk ballad meant to be sung on repeat, Van Wey‚Äôs intepretation had
three parts. Throughout the first two, Van Wey crooned throatily over a
piano and zither in a dark lament. Entering the third part, a half step,
a motif, quickened the pace, and the song shifted into dance tempo, Van
Wey singing lightly over Mamzelle Zizi‚Äôs pain.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Pov piti has
inspired other, even more upbeat versions, from New Orleans jazz icon
Dr. John‚Äôs 2000 rendition of Mamzelle Zizi to the 2001 Orchestre
Bourbon‚Äôs rendition (led by Georges Fourcade) of Mamzelle Zizi and
recorded on the album <em>Le barde cr√©ole</em>.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>

<p>The pov piti invoked by Matana Roberts is not a Creole dance tune.
Matana begins her version of this poor little girl‚Äôs story with silence,
broken gently by melodic piano chords. Behind the piano are choked,
coughing sounds, barely comprehensible, almost words. A wave of
synth-electronic sound with percussive accents begins to flood in. As it
does, the choking becomes a strangled stutter, the stutter transforms
into guttural cries, the cries become hoarse screams. The expression is
one of either extreme pain or extreme pleasure‚Äîor both, at the point
where the two coincide, a sonic expression of sensation at its most
extreme. Amber Musser, writing on race and masochism, theorizes
sensation as an analytic, as ‚Äúboth individual and impersonal; it
occupies a sphere of multiplicity without being tethered to
identity.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Sensation, then, might be likened to raw data‚Äîexcept
sensation requires corporeality.</p>

<p>The body attached to these cries haunts their sound. In these first
twenty seconds of the song, it is impossible to ascribe a gender to the
body screaming. The cries are genderless and ungendered. Still, these
first two minutes of pov piti are marked by excess, the kind of excess
that invokes a necessary corporeality, bridging data (digital sound) and
sensation, suggestive but not illustrative (yet) of identity, intention,
or power. An excess of sound, an excess of desire, though it is unclear
whether that desire is to communicate, to cry for help, to continue the
torment or pleasure, or to simply be heard. The cries range from choked
gasps to garbled screams to inarticulate howls, loud, hoarse, and
coarse. The strain on the vocal chords, the throat, the voice, the
breath can be heard in the rasp, sigh, screech, and scrape of air
expelled from the body. The effort required to produce the screams is
tangible, even as words, in fact, <em>language itself</em>, remains
incomprehensible, lost to sensation. By the end of the second minute, it
seems every possible <em>human</em> iteration sounding out excess has been
achieved. The screams crescendo before descending into strangled rattles
of breath and half-formed croaks. As they do, a jazz saxophone begins to
play. A woman begins to speak, her words more clear. The woman is Matana
Roberts channeling her ancestress, Marie Th√©r√®ze ‚ÄúCoincoin‚Äù Metoyer.</p>

<p>In short, decisive sentences, Coin Coin, an enslaved woman of African
descent, offers testimony. ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù Coin Coin, through Roberts, declares
over and over in sing-song. Coin Coin reflects. On her birth. On her
Catholic baptism. On her owner. On the death of her mother from yellow
fever. On being a slave, a ‚Äúnigra,‚Äù and therefore a ‚Äútool of the earth.‚Äù
She repeats her name: ‚ÄúI am Coin Coin Coin Coin Coin Coin Coinnnn Coin,‚Äù
pronouncing it ‚ÄúKwon Kwe.‚Äù She muses in and on memory. Her narrative
devolves into a refrain: ‚ÄúI was only 16. I was only 16. There will never
be any pictures of me.‚Äù As Coin Coin/Roberts speaks, in the spaces left
behind by, between, and synchronized with her words, a second/third
voice can be heard. Faint and femme, this ghost echoes everything
spoken, the same historical narrative, but in French.</p>

<p>Matana Roberts is a sound experimentalist, jazz saxophonist, composer
and improviser. Born on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, Roberts currently resides
in New York City. <em>Coin Coin: Gens de Couleurs Libres</em> is the first
chapter of her second project. The work is named after the formerly
enslaved woman of African descent named Marie Th√©r√®ze Coincoin Metoyer,
the founder of the Cane River Creoles community of Natchitoches,
Louisiana. Coin Coin was born a slave in 1742. Her owner, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis, was the commandant of Natchitoches when the
rural outpost, some four miles north of New Orleans, was still under
French control. In 1767, a yellow fever epidemic decimated the outpost,
killing her mother and her owner. With St. Denis‚Äôs passing, ownership of
Coin Coin passed to his youngest daughter, who leased her to Claude
Thomas Pierre Metoyer. Coin Coin bore Metoyer several children, some of
whom Metoyer then freed. In 1778, Metoyer finally freed Coin Coin
herself. By this time, Louisiana had passed from French ownership to
Spanish. As a free woman of color, Coin Coin took advantage of Spanish
laws on land settlement to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù and eventually claim a plot of land
in the area of Natchitoches, which she farmed with her children and
slaves of her own. By 1810, Coin Coin had seven living sons with land,
cattle, and fifty-eight slaves among them. The only family in the area
to own more slaves than Coin Coin and her children were the white
Metoyers and their extended families.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>

<p>Roberts, through family lore and history, learned she was descended from
one of these children. She speaks in interviews about growing up steeped
in references to her ancestress‚Äîincluding a grandfather who used to call
Roberts ‚ÄúCoin Coin‚Äù to tease. Constellation Records, Roberts‚Äôs label,
describes <em>Coin Coin</em> as ‚Äúa multi-chapter work that combines conceptual
scoring (graphic notation, ‚Äòchance‚Äô strategies), storytelling and
historical narrative, performative theatre (personae, costume,
multi-media), and a deeply considered channeling of personal ancestry
and the ‚Äòuniversal‚Äô experience of Africans in America.‚Äù Peter Margasak,
writing for National Public Radio, framed Coin Coin even further: ‚ÄúShe
[Roberts] realized putting together fragments and snippets that
wouldn‚Äôt serve much purpose on their own, could result in something new
and meaningful.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

<p>Roberts calls her technique ‚Äúpanoramic sound quilting,‚Äù but her act of
quilting moves well beyond the audiovisual experience to encompass and
involve her past, herself, her band, live audiences, the jazz community,
a digital community of lurkers, followers, rebloggers, and other sharers
and casual listener-viewers.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> When the first chapter, <em>Gens de
couleur libres</em>, was released in 2011, Roberts used archival material,
personal recollections, interviews with family members, and digital and
social media in a very dynamic fashion. She created the blog <em>In the
Midst of Memory</em> and posted clips from the album. When Roberts
eventually uploaded the full album on SoundCloud, she embedded links to
it on her blog, alongside historical information about Marie Th√©r√®ze
Coincoin Metoyer, New Orleans <em>gens de couleur libres</em>, slavery,
Louisiana, St. Louis, Chicago, and more. The liner notes for the
physical album included graphic notation Roberts created while making
the album; that blog no longer exists. The album remains available on
SoundCloud for free.</p>

</div>

<p>In the process of composing <em>Mississippi Moonchile</em> and <em>River Run
Thee</em>, <em>Coin Coin</em> chapters 2 and 3, Roberts began using her Instagram
and Tumblr accounts (@steelkiltrose) to document and share her
cross-country journey around and throughout the United States.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup>
While traveling and researching material for these and subsequent <em>Coin
Coin</em> chapters, Roberts shared her experience in the form of digital
photography and commentary, readily engaging with followers who joined
her virtually on her travels. <em>Mississippi Moonchile</em> was released in
2013, <em>River Runs Thee</em> in 2015. The Instagram and Tumblr accounts also
no longer exist. A short film, completed in 2010 in Montreal,
accompanied the release of <em>Mississippi Moonchile</em>. Directed by Radwan
Moumneh, it remains available on Vimeo and YouTube. In the grayscale
audiovisual romp through sound, text, and spectral movement, Roberts,
channeling Coin Coin, stands on empty streets in a white dress.
Saxophone in hand, she plays a song that at times the viewer cannot hear
over the screams of her archive. In <em>River Run Thee</em>, Roberts recites
from slave ship manifests, British Naval ship registers, and travel
narratives. In her accounting, the words of men like Captain G. L.
Sullivan, whose crew intercepted and seized slave ships after the formal
abolition of the trade in 1808, reverberate against a chanting
chorus.<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup></p>

<p>Hauntings and crossings‚Äîthe sound of them, the emotion in them, and the
sensation of them‚Äîdominate Matana‚Äôs project. In a 2015 interview,
Roberts described her process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a really big interest in the spirit world: spooks and the
things we can‚Äôt necessarily see but feel. An exploration of ghosts and
things of that nature. There was a period of my childhood where I
tried to contact people on that plane and I stopped doing that as a
teenager because I heard it can induce states of psychosis if you
don‚Äôt have a proper guide. So I left that and I realised that music is
my medium, my guide.<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The song ‚ÄúPov Piti,‚Äù the <em>Coin Coin</em> project, and Matana Roberts herself
form a singularity‚Äîan epicenter or node‚Äîof black digital practice and
its relationship with slavery‚Äôs archive. Roberts and her ghosts pose
critical questions and possibilities for what can and cannot be done
with the data found in slavery‚Äôs archive, with digital and social media,
and historical narratives of bondage‚Äîparticularly narratives of intimacy
and sex, violence, and property. Roberts feared hearing voices would
induce states of psychosis, then reframed her haunting against
encounters with her own ancestry as a descendant of Coin Coin. She
created sonic histories where poor little enslaved girls scream,
materialize on city streets, and spill themselves across blogs, grams,
and tweets. Unafraid of emotion, Roberts rooted the unspeakable affect
of the trade in her own mourning, even sounding out the cries heard in
pov piti herself, in the wake of her mother‚Äôs death.<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> She played
with quantity, layering femme whispers upon femme whispers, one colonial
language over another. Coin Coin is (‚ÄúI am‚Äù) regardless of whether there
is visual proof (‚ÄúThere will never be any pictures of me‚Äù), and in
Roberts‚Äôs creation, she time-travels from the past into a new present to
live again.</p>

<p>Fluid and fugitive, Matana Roberts and Coin Coin do not occupy a single
digital project space or site. Coin Coin, through Roberts, does what she
could not in life‚Äîshe absconds. She becomes Maroon code. The <em>Coin Coin</em>
project escapes from written documents, the analog, and the archive. It
transforms the use of digital tools as they become available and so
transforms the listener-user‚Äôs relationship to sound, subjects, and
subjectivity, the living and the dead. At points, over and over, Coin
Coin disappears from sight and reappears on sites in whispers and
phantasms. It is possible to find, for instance, images Roberts
previously posted on Instagram, where they have been archived by
different jazz websites. This mediated existence echoes the archive
enslaved men and women created with their testimony, in slave narratives
dictated to but edited by white abolitionists. Marisa Parham, theorizing
hauntings in African American literature, described them as more than
echoes of past people, lives, or experiences. Hauntings, particularly of
past trauma, both return from beyond and constitute lifeways in the
present. The <em>Coin Coin</em> project, with its missing and mediated,
ephemeral and historically tangible, gives hauntings a power to use and
be used in the service of a historical narrative that does not reproduce
humans as solely nodes of data.</p>

<p>Matana Roberts‚Äôs intellectual and creative works illustrate the kind of
interventions black digital practice makes in conversations around
digital humanities, justice, and history. Using digital tools to
excavate slavery‚Äôs archive generates histories of intimate violence,
torment, and dispossession. A digital praxis attuned to black life and
not to slavery‚Äôs penchant for black death cannot ignore loss,
heartbreak, absence, and silence. Black digital practice makes space for
this praxis, for black diasporic longing, insurgence, hauntings, and
community mourning to inform how digital tools might be used to uncover
acts of resistance, insurgent politics, and evidence of self-fashioning.
Black digital practice incorporates analog pasts; transgresses
boundaries between institutions, communities, and individuals; and is
unafraid of the ephemeral or incremental in comparison. In the black
diasporic subterranean that is slavery‚Äôs archive, black digital practice
has the potential to call into being the fluidity, dispersal, and
mobility that has always existed alongside structural, personal, and
intimate embodiments of violence. It offers an opportunity to look both
into and at the data without losing emotion, sensation, and redress as a
framing for black life.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-we-keep-the-light">Part 4. We Keep the Light</h2>

<p>Dark space and illumination represent the twin poles of commodification
slavery necessitated. One occasioned the disappeared and dispossessed,
the genocidal stakes at the heart of making a New World, the other a
rapacious and ravenous consumption only colonialism could beget. A
xroads praxis exceeds this binary. It recognizes that the absence is
there and then attends to it.</p>

</div>

<p>To return to the spiderweb of Maury voyages, in ‚ÄúBlack Haunts in the
Anthropocene‚Äù Parham writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find the images haunting, but the dark lines of the triangle trade
are not sooty from centuries of moving Africans into new world
slavery, nor from moving the fruits of their labor to fuel others‚Äô
growth. They are dark because those sea roots were there before the
slave trade. This fact gives me a feeling of a timeless before and
after, which is difficult to reconcile with any sense of enduring
historical impact. Even despite their immense violence, the men
pushing and pulling bodies across the Atlantic were only men, hoping
for a good wind. A bug on a leaf, torn from the tree.<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Striving, desiring, lusting for a xroads practice affirms that there is
black humanity somewhere on the other side of the Middle Passage, after
the hurricane, deep in the prison cell. At the crossroads, the things we
make (hashtags, tweets, Instagram posts, multimedia exhibits, archives,
and blogs) may remain or they may disappear, may break or may be
stolen/archived/corrupted, even without our permission. But they haunt,
they scream, and they remain accountable to the living and lived. In a
xroads praxis, the destination is less important than our survival, our
machines are less important than the humans inside them, and we never
forget that even in the dark we keep the light.</p>
