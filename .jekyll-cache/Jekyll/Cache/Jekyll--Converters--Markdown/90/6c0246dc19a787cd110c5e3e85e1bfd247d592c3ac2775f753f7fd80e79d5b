I"Ô—<p>In two <em>New York Times</em> articles, published ten years apart, Staceyann
Chin and Marlon James tell deeply personal stories about their
experiences as queer Jamaican writers now living in the United States.
New York City, the star of both pieces, offered to both ‚Äúsexiles‚Äù the
refuge and freedom intrinsic to the anonymity and individuality that was
potentially available far away from their homophobic and claustrophobic
homeland.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Chin‚Äôs 2004 piece declares, ‚ÄúNo one cared if I kissed
girls,‚Äù and James ends his 2015 piece with this observation: ‚ÄúNobody
cared that my jeans had a nine-inch rise. I no longer looked over my
shoulder in the dark.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The freedom these declarations imply is based
less on the isolation of the individual on a quest for independence than
on Chin‚Äôs and James‚Äôs (re)making of the self via the (re)making of
community. It is not that no one cared but that a curated constellation
of people cared differently. Chin‚Äôs writing offered her a global stage
on which she could gain emotional and financial support by ‚Äúteaching the
poetics of writing the self,‚Äù and James similarly supported his sexile
by writing his ‚Äúway out‚Äù of Jamaica. Though the narrative of these
published essays seems to be one of writing oneself away from the
rejecting homespace, Chin and James were also actively writing
themselves into a remembered Jamaica and a diasporic Caribbean. In these
essays, and in much of their other ‚Äúwritings of the self,‚Äù they both
write their way into a Caribbeanness that their autobiographical
writings work to redefine as inclusive of nonheteronormative choices.</p>

<p>Writings of the self are not a new method of reshaping the contours of
what might be called ‚ÄúCaribbean.‚Äù As Sandra Pouchet Paquet argues in her
pivotal 2002 study <em>Caribbean Autobiography: Cultural Identity and
Self-Representation</em>, there is an extensive history of life-writing in
the Caribbean literary canon that attempt such interventions via print
publications, beginning with early-nineteenth-century narratives such as
those by the Hart sisters of Antigua (Elizabeth Hart Twaites and Anne
Hart Gilbert) and <em>The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave,
Related by Herself</em>. Paquet‚Äôs argument elsewhere for the ‚Äúcentrality of
the personal narrative to the unfolding creative project that was
Caribbean literature‚Äù positions life-writing as foundational to the
building of the modern Caribbean canon.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> With this essay I hope to
expand the range of such narratives to include not only individual,
institutionally vetted essays like those published by Chin and James in
the <em>New York Times</em> but also digital writing, specifically posts from
personal blogs maintained by Caribbean writers. The autobiographical
narratives shared digitally by a number of Caribbean writers in the
early twenty-first century were a new, yet familiar, form of
life-writing.</p>

<p>Though blogs necessarily present and respond to forces different from
those we find in more formally crafted autobiographical narratives, they
nonetheless can be read as recent contributions to what Paquet names a
‚Äúcontested literary space [that forms] the foundations or diverse
conceptions of individual and group identity‚Äù for Caribbean peoples.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
In the mid-twentieth century, Caribbean autobiography grew as a method
of claiming ground in this ‚Äúcontested literary space.‚Äù From George
Lamming‚Äôs <em>In the Castle of My Skin</em> to Derek Walcott‚Äôs <em>Another Life</em>,
Caribbean writers struggled to combat aporias in literary production and
epistemological models and write themselves into visibility from the
margins of colonial empires. But this tradition was predominantly male
and heterosexual. Even as questions of female sexual agency became more
central in autobiographical texts of the late twentieth century, these
questions were most often about what women did with cisgender men or
sometimes about what they did by themselves, but rarely were the
questions about what women did with other women or with noncisgender
men. Therefore, while the twentieth-century Caribbean literary canon
slowly became diversified with various life stories, the voices of queer
writers remained at low volume. In this essay, I examine how two
Jamaican writers in particular further diversified the Caribbean
autobiographical tradition at the turn of the century by centering
questions of queerness while experimenting with the formal and communal
affordances (and limitations) of blogging platforms.</p>

<h2 id="positions-of-enunciation">‚ÄúPositions of Enunciation‚Äù</h2>

</blockquote>

<p>The form of blogging‚Äîwith its imagined audience(s), networked sites, and
nested comments‚Äîmakes evident the tensions and interdependence inherent
in navigating individual and group identity. Traditional print
autobiographical works convey these tensions secondhand, but the
interactive nature of blogs lays such conflict and connectedness bare,
particularly when a blogger positions themself as speaking from or to a
specific community. In his 1990 essay ‚ÄúCultural Identity and Diaspora,‚Äù
Stuart Hall writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Practices of representation always implicate the positions from which
we speak or write‚Äîthe positions of <em>enunciation</em>. What recent theories
of enunciation suggest is that, though we speak, so to say ‚Äúin our own
name,‚Äù of ourselves and from our own experience, nevertheless who
speaks, and the subject who is spoken of, are never identical, never
exactly in the same place.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hall provides language to think about the ways Caribbean bloggers a
decade later were involved in ‚Äúpractices of representation‚Äù that were
dependent on, and deeply dedicated to, the positions/places/people from
which they ‚Äúenunciated‚Äù themselves into the World Wide Web. Because
their blog posts were self-consciously instituted practices of
self-representation, wherein the distance between the enunciated ‚ÄúI‚Äù and
the enunciating ‚ÄúI‚Äù was less mediated by editors and publishing
processes (and the lengths of time inherent in such processes) than in
traditionally published autobiographical narratives, the different
‚Äúplaces‚Äù of the subject and of the speaker were more closely aligned.
And the interactive format of blogging promised that the different
places of the speaker and the subject, <em>and</em> of their audiences, could
also be (or be made) more closely aligned.</p>

<p>This promise of unfixed positioning offered to the self-speaking subject
by early blogging platforms is a key difference between print and
digital autobiography, a key difference between most, if not all, print
and digital enunciations of the ‚ÄúI.‚Äù From 2000 to 2010, particularly
toward the latter half of the decade, Caribbean writers of all kinds
began to turn to blogging to speak themselves into the digital universe
and to connect to established and potential audiences for their
nondigital writings. The work that blogs could (and still can) do for
such Caribbean ‚Äúlitbloggers‚Äù is varied. <sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Blogs might serve the
function of ‚Äúreaching out‚Äù to readers of one‚Äôs published work to simply
make a connection; they might function to publicize work and
appearances; they might serve to grow create/grow an audience; they
might offer insight into an author‚Äôs process. In the Caribbean
blogosphere, writers such as Tobias Buckell, Nalo Hopkinson, Nicholas
Laughlin, and Geoffrey Philp were relatively early adopters of the form,
embracing the advantages the internet offered for communication with
various audiences (including among themselves). Although their blogs
were arguably just as autobiographical as Chin‚Äôs and James‚Äôs, I narrowed
my corpus for this essay because I am particularly interested in how
queer Caribbean writers navigated the shifting terrain of digital
representation, of self-enunciation and audience. Additionally, the
timing of Chin‚Äôs and James‚Äôs blogs offers diverse perspectives of
digital autobiographical writing across the peak decade of Caribbean
blogging. Chin began her cyberjournal in 2001, which was earlier than
most of her Caribbean contemporaries, and ended in 2006; James began
blogging in 2006 and ended in 2009, when blogging as a whole became less
autobiographical (as more writers turned to Facebook and other social
media platforms designed specifically for self-representation).</p>

<p>While by the end of the 2000s writers might have questioned if anyone
was reading <em>their</em> blog, they did not question if anyone read blogs at
all or the legitimacy of blogging as a genre.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Chin‚Äôs early posts
indicate the pervasive uncertainty surrounding her entrance into what
was then a fairly new field of digital public self-disclosure. Her
choice of a cyberjournal instead of a titled blog is owed in large part
to her relatively early adoption of this form of communication.
According to Jill Walker Rettberg, while ‚Äúthe first online diaries
appeared around 1994,‚Äù they were not yet called <em>blogs</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Web log</em> at that time was used to refer to the statistics available
to website administrators showing the number of visitors to a website.
In 1997, Jorn Barger proposed that the term <em>weblog</em> be used to refer
to websites that post links to interesting material with commentary‚Ä¶.
Posts in these early weblogs were brief, and although the comments
usually had a clear individual voice and offered personal opinions,
the content was usually comments on news stories and online finds
rather than stories from the writer‚Äôs life. Weblogs tended to be seen
in opposition to online diaries, which were more confessional‚Ä¶.
[But] within a few years, the once quite separate genres of online
diaries and blogs merged. Blog posts became longer and more
essayistic, often using a more personal voice, and online diaries came
to include more essayistic material and commentary in addition to the
autobiographical content.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chin‚Äôs cyberjournal appeared amid the merging of online diaries and
political and cultural commentaries. Even as her posts slowed in
frequency after the first two years, she maintained her unique mix of
uncompromisingly mundane chronicle, large-scale polemic, and snippets of
draft poetry until the middle of the decade. This type of
life-writing‚Äîthis public, almost immediate, seemingly unvetted by others
self-representation‚Äîallows for a slide into a perceived over-sharing.
However, insofar as Chin sometimes refers to multiple revisions of her
entries before posting (until mid-2002 she did not actually have the
ability to post the entries herself and had to send drafts to someone
with more technical knowledge for posting), we must consider her
intensely personal style purposeful.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Chin‚Äôs entries chronicle her performance work, her travel and days off,
her time with lovers/family/friends, and her random interactions with
people she meets at colleges and the doctor‚Äôs office. Threaded through
these seemingly inconsequential revelations are the quotidian
experiences of micro and macro aggressions against Caribbean queerness
and Chin‚Äôs insistent claiming of her right to Jamaicanness, to Brooklyn,
and to something approaching ‚Äúhome.‚Äù As with more polished, published
autobiographical narratives, Chin‚Äôs cyberjournal imagines that the
details of her life represent a larger import for her readers.
Sometimes, however, the technicalities of web-writing, which were new to
her and had to be filtered through her webmaster‚Äôs mysterious magic,
distanced her from her imagined audience. When shifting her posts to a
new site in early 2002, she temporarily lost the comments section of the
cyberjournal, and in several of her posts she questions whether anyone
is listening. On 3 March 2002, in her first post to the cyberjournal in
its new home, she writes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rambling because it feels like I‚Äôm
talking to a blank screen. I was more connected when people were
responding to stuff I was writing. Hopefully people will respond again
and then it won‚Äôt be such a one-sided unorgasmic experience.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> The
comments section for her posts soon began to fill again, however, and
the pleasures of self-enunciation resumed.</p>

<p>In general, I have organized this essay around three questions of
digital self-enunciation: To whom do these writers speak? Of what do
they choose to (not) speak? And how do‚Äîhow can‚Äîthey speak? These
questions are about content as much as technology. Print capitalism
continues to shape digital publishing via the forms of creative
expression that can be recognized as such. Of course, capitalism in
general also affects digital writing through the limitations of
commercial digital spaces, which are often the spaces most available to
Caribbean writers in the region for digital expression. Discourse on
digital publishing often promotes the practice as freeing and enabling
for creative enterprise, but, as with the technologies of language and
print, digital communication also structures what can be said. In this
section, I turn to the what and the how of queer Jamaican
self-enunciation through the digital technologies and platforms popular
in the early twenty-first century.</p>

<p>What could be written of queer Caribbean selfhood on blogs of this time?
The answer is elusive, since it lies as much in what was not written as
in what was and could be written, both via the available technologies
and in a public space. For the ‚Äúnot written‚Äù we can look to a post‚Äôs
comments, which might reveal silences and silencings by the blogger, or
to unmentioned events signaled as contemporary by the time/date stamps
built into most blog technologies. But even nondigital autobiographies
by queer Caribbean writers have had to contend with necessary silences
and the constraints of form in order to tell truths larger than an
individual life. Michelle Cliff‚Äôs first book, <em>Claiming an Identity They
Taught Me to Despise</em>, is a collection of autobiographical writings
published in 1980 that weaves together myth, literature, and personal
history with a blend of prose and poetry. Cliff begins by declaring, ‚ÄúI
must make myself visible against my habitat,‚Äù then immediately
acknowledges that ‚Äúthere exists a certain danger in peeling back.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
Two years later Audre Lorde published <em>Zami: A New Spelling of My Name</em>,
naming her autobiographical <em>K√ºnstlerroman</em> composed of
‚Äúdreams/myths/histories‚Äù a ‚Äúbiomythography.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> As lesbians of color,
even with the relative privilege of diasporic residency, both Cliff and
Lorde convey that ‚Äúwriting the self‚Äù requires formal experimentation and
generic promiscuity to safely tell and not-tell their stories, to speak
(to echo Stuart Hall) in their own name, of themselves and from their
own experience.</p>

<p>The act of writing‚Äîof writing about oneself especially‚Äîimplies a level
of freedom enjoyed by the writer, even when that narrative might focus
on being unfree.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Both Cliff and Lorde allude to this paradoxical
freedom to name their oppressions as shadowed by people and
circumstances they ‚Äúcan not yet afford to name.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> In digital spaces,
this freedom for Caribbean queer writers to tell is still noticeably
constrained by the need to not-tell. Marlon James began his blog, first
named <em>Croaking Marley</em>, in 2006, during his time as a graduate student
at Wilkes University in Pennsylvania. Beyond a September 2006 post
referring to his being on a student visa and in Pennsylvania, however,
he provides little information about his time at Wilkes. In his early
posts, he writes ‚Äúour‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äù primarily for Jamaicans and refers to
himself as a nonresident in America. While there are a few personal
details to be gleaned from his first posts‚Äîsuch as his turn to comics as
a kid (‚ÄúI learned more about accepting my outsider status from X-men
than both the Bible and Notes From the Underground‚Äù<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>)‚Äîthe
autobiographical nature of the blog is most visible in his discussions
of his work, his process of writing, and his work to become a writer.
Readers learn more about James the capital-W Writer than James the
person. That is, until about five months into the blog, in November
2006, when he suddenly gifts readers with the post ‚ÄúWhere I‚Äôm Coming
From,‚Äù which details two life-shaping moments for the young Marlon, in
primary and secondary school in Jamaica, and ends with the revelation of
a drastic decision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was just no way I could continue like this, hated because I like
art and lit and history, didn‚Äôt like football (soccer) and walked and
talked funny. I realized that more than everything, it must have been
my screwed up way of speaking that made people hate me.</p>

  <p>So in the summer of 1987 I stopped speaking.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>James‚Äôs next blog post, published a week later, discusses writing sex
scenes in literary fiction: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to good explicit action the
gays guys seem to have it locked even if the straight audiences may not
want to read it.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> There‚Äôs no mention of the revelation in the prior
post, making its last sentence about his refusal to speak a cliffhanger
of monstruous proportions. Perhaps the full stop after ‚Äústopped
speaking‚Äù is meant to reinforce the decision of the young Marlon. Yet
the adult Marlon does keep speaking, albeit about something else, in the
very next post. And that is one of the liberating affordances of the
nonlinear, post-based format of blogs. Continuity of narrative is
unnecessary, and positions of enunciation are unfixed. One can tell and
tell, and then not tell. One can simply ‚Äústop speaking,‚Äù then begin
anew, elsewhere, in the next post.</p>

<p>In 2013‚Äì14, James returned to some of the material in ‚ÄúWhere I‚Äôm Coming
From‚Äù for a vaguely fictional, second-person-perspective, thirteen-part
series of vignettes for the online literary publication <em>Revolver</em>,<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>
and then again for his more-well-known 2015 essay ‚ÄúFrom Jamaica to
Minnesota to Myself‚Äù for the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>. The latter piece
is generally considered his official ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù essay, but the earlier
pieces evidence his experiments with strategic ‚Äúpositions of
enunciation‚Äù in individual blog posts as well as across the posts for
the four-year duration of the blog. Despite the backward chronology of
the blog format (especially for noncontemporary readers), our tendency
toward narrative often leads readers to perceive the individual posts as
part of a whole, stitching together congruent elements to cloak
irrelevant or even contradictory ones. In autobiography, we read for
what Lisa Lowe calls ‚Äúa fluid story of a unitary [author].‚Äù<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> The
technology that enables blogs makes it nearly impossible to read them as
fluid narratives; but readers nevertheless need to work against the
impulse to suture posts if they seek the stories told by the gaps,
paradoxes, and silences. The writers themselves often aim to present a
unitary subject in their blogs, repeating anecdotes and referring to
previous posts to weave together a composite but coherent identity.
James‚Äôs reworking of material from his blog, first to the <em>Revolver</em>
series and then to the <em>New York Times</em> <em>Magazine</em> essay, forces us to
pay closer attention to how he leveraged the blog format to tell (and to
not-tell) as he worked out how he wanted to form this autobiographical
narrative into a fluid story.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>Chin also reworks material from her cyberjournal entries for later
performances and publications, including her 2009 memoir, <em>The Other
Side of Paradise</em>, which crafts into a linear narrative several of the
stories she had previously told via her blog, her poetry, and her
one-woman shows.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Her navigation of various positions of enunciation
becomes obvious as the same stories are retold and refashioned. More
supple than James‚Äôs reworking of his stories of silence and subterfuge
for <em>Revolver</em> and later the <em>New York Times</em>, Chin‚Äôs autobiographical
narratives are revised across genres and reordered several times. In the
(cyber)space of her cyberjournal, which allowed for polemic, poetry,
dramatic monologue, and asynchronous dialogue with readers, Chin could
endlessly ‚Äúremix‚Äù her writing choices and, as Jeannine Murray-Rom√°n
argues, was able to ‚Äúamplify‚Äù the stories of self she wished to
tell.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> Within the reach and technological limits of their chosen
platforms, queer Caribbean bloggers like Chin and James can manipulate
circulation of their writings of the self‚Äîrevealing, remixing,
amplifying, and suppressing‚Äîin ways unavailable to earlier writers such
as Michelle Cliff and Audre Lorde.</p>

<p>There remains, however, a drive toward print publication evident in the
blogs of this period. Although they were less constrained by the printed
page and the order it entails, bloggers like Chin and James, who
imagined themselves in a literary lineage with canonical (Caribbean)
writers, had to make for themselves the prestige that the printed page
(and selection by the hands of print capitalism) grants to published
writers. Consequently, in their blog posts, Chin and James position not
only their personal experiences but the very labor of writing as what
individualizes them, makes them special, and makes their lives
representative of worthy (Caribbean and/or queer) lives. For both Chin
and James, the labor of writing, both on and off their blogs, became one
of the themes that threaded the varied posts together. Whether in
celebration or vulnerable self-questioning, whether as an aside or as
the focus of a full post, it is the <em>work</em> of writing that they most
often reveal as they express their struggles with their chosen art forms
and with the industries they must contend with to become capital-W
Writers. This focus on the labor of writing also becomes one of the
threads that connect them with their audience and with other writers of
the time experimenting with the affordances of digital platforms.</p>

<h2 id="navigating-digital-networks">Navigating Digital Networks</h2>

<p>Nicholas Laughlin‚Äôs 2006 <em>Global Voices</em> post titled ‚Äú11 Key Moments in
[Anglo-] Caribbean Blog History‚Äù provides an overview of how Caribbean
bloggers in the 2000s took themselves seriously as a network and took
blogging seriously as a genre.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Being a part of this networked crew
meant linking to other blogs. It meant celebrating when you or your
colleagues were mentioned elsewhere on the net or in print; it meant
watching for ‚Äúspikes‚Äù in traffic and perhaps pandering to these spikes.
Overall, it was the Caribbean reading the Caribbean writing in a
technologically new way.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> Much of that is lost now, for multiple
reasons, including, as mentioned above, writers revising their digital
selves. The rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,
and Instagram has contributed to the decline of Caribbean blogging. In
different ways, each of these platforms has become a site for
‚Äúmicroblogging,‚Äù where one can present open-ended (and endlessly open to
comment) snippets of one‚Äôs life. And where the more one writes, the
faster one‚Äôs past posts disappear down the timeline, a timeport of
‚Äúsupermodernity.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> The ease of posting to such social media spaces,
versus crafting and publishing a blog post, and the near-instant rewards
of social media likes and comments (themselves also often easier to
enact than blog commentary) have, understandably, made the work of
blogging less attractive. Many of the bloggers Laughlin mentions in his
<em>Global Voices</em> overview no longer maintain their sites or have slowed
their posting activity considerably.</p>

<p>The blog posts and corresponding comments that remain available to us
today are evidence of the active network of Caribbean bloggers that
existed before the decline in the 2010s. Some of James‚Äôs posts reference
Laughlin, Geoffrey Philp, or Annie Paul as inspirations (or instigators)
for the content, particularly for lists or challenges such as in ‚ÄúFive
Note Mojo‚Äù and ‚ÄúFive Songs I Must Have on My i-Pod.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Although Chin,
blogging as she did earlier in the decade, was somewhat outside this
particular network, the comments on her cyberjournal and her own use of
hyperlinks indicate that she was similarly navigating an online
community.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> James had been very much entrenched in a more Caribbean
digital network. Even the beginning of his personal blog seems to have
stemmed from a playful taunt by Laughlin in his 2006 <em>Global Voices</em>
post ‚ÄúWest Indian Literature Online.‚Äù When listing current bloggers in
the ‚Äúsmall, vibrant, and growing literary sector in the Caribbean
blogosphere,‚Äù Laughlin prodded: ‚ÄúAnd maybe Marlon James‚Äîwhose first
novel, <em>John Crow‚Äôs Devil</em>, was nominated for both a Commonwealth
Writers‚Äô Prize and a Los Angeles Times Book Prize‚Äîwill start a ‚Äòreal‚Äô
blog one of these days‚Äîmeanwhile, he‚Äôs been keeping a so¬≠called ‚Äòplog‚Äô
over at Amazon.com, where he‚Äôs been writing about, among other things,
Jean Rhys and literacy in Jamaica.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> On 29 May, James commented on
Laughlin‚Äôs post: ‚ÄúAlright! Alright! Damn it! I will set up my blog and
stop with this ‚Äòplogging‚Äô business right away.‚Äù And the first post on
his personal blog is dated 30 May. From posts and comments like these‚Äîon
sites such as <em>Global Voices</em> as well as on popular personal blogs such
as Annie Paul‚Äôs <em>Active Voice</em> and Geoffrey Philp‚Äôs blog‚Äîwe can trace
the ways this Caribbean digital network shaped many of the blog posts
published.<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> Reading across blog posts and comments, we become privy
to some of the workings of these networked influences: the conversations
that were public but hidden in the comments section and those that were
conducted privately via emails and face-to-face dialogues but then
hinted at in comment threads. These exchanges are articulated into the
blog posts that are eventually crafted for the public, representing
individuals navigating a community of digital and nondigital encounters
as they write themselves into subjectivity. Even as the size and very
existence of an audience may be questioned, this blogging constitutes a
writing against invisibility and into community.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, it is this community that also works against strategic
invisibility. Deletion, whether deliberate or accidental, is never
guaranteed to be complete when there are so many potential avenues of
reference to the deleted material. As it is, what remains available from
the blogs of this time indicates that even in focusing on only Chin and
James, I am working with not just a partial but a palimpsestic and
changeable archive of revised and in-progress autobiography, an archive
constructed of simultaneously too much and too little material. Much of
the material is no longer available because older portions of blogs, or
in some cases entire sites for them, have been neglected or removed by
the authors as they progressed to other platforms and to other selves.
And the material we do have some access to can be overwhelming in scope
(neither Chin nor James are known for their reticence or brevity).
Still, less than fifteen years after Chin closed her cyberjournal, and
ten years after James stopped posting on his blog, there is significant
and traceable evidence of what might be considered archival loss.
Although I have a sizeable portion of Chin‚Äôs early cyberjournal entries
saved in hard copy, and the Internet Archive provides additional access
through 2006, the blog is no longer available on her website. When I
began this project, I felt an urgency to capture James‚Äôs 2006‚Äì9 blog
before he decided it was not in keeping with his post‚ÄìBooker Prize self,
but I later learned that sometime between 2007 and 2010 he had already
significantly revamped the blog to reflect his post‚Äì<em>Night Women</em> self.
Such archival gaps are often strategic, and in many ways they are built
into each author‚Äôs initial technological choices: James used BlogSpot,
which allows for (his) deletion of all comments; and Chin‚Äôs site was
built on Adobe Flash technology that is no longer supported online. In a
2003 interview I conducted with Chin, she revealed, ‚ÄúThe kind of
half-poems that exist in my journal never go anywhere else. There are no
copies of them anywhere else. If my website crashes‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Of
course, that never really is ‚Äúit‚Äù when one participates in digital
community, but the threat and allure of deletion remain integral parts
of writing the self online. Revision and deletion, the opportunity to
take back information‚Äîinasmuch as one can take back anything from the
internet‚Äîoffers a blogging safety net. This is particularly important
for writers like Chin, who occupy vulnerable social and professional
positions: black, female, migrant, queer, un(der)published,
un(der)employed.</p>

<p>Now, almost two decades after Chin began her cyberjournal, internet
users are more familiar with this paradox of the permanent-but-ephemeral
archive of digital writing.<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> But what did digital permanence mean
for bloggers when the genre was relatively new and search engines were
limited? For this reason, I have been selective in my use of materials
from Chin‚Äôs and James‚Äôs digital writings. I recognize that my own
archiving of posts that were perhaps created with ephemerality in mind
may be counter to the safety net that I argue blogging provided in those
early years. At the same time, I want to convey the spirit of this
moment and the positions and possibilities of enunciation blogging
offered queer Caribbean writers with access to digital platforms. When I
asked Chin in 2003 why she chose to start sharing her life online, she
responded,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of white straight history is allowed into the canon. Even the
idea of the canon is very white and straight and I feel like the web
gives us the place where we can write our own histories. Whether
they‚Äôre relevant or irrelevant. I don‚Äôt send out emails to people with
my cyberjournal entries in them; I chose not to do that for a reason.
So it is only the ones who want to come. And that‚Äôs what I like about
it.</p>

  <p>The net gives you a way to grow maybe longer and wider fingers.<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reaching with these longer and wider fingers for what audience may come,
Chin and James equivocally thrust their stories of self into the public
domain. Frequently expressing doubt about the venture, they nevertheless
continued to write themselves, pushing against canonical expectations
while creating digital space for others in a collective of Caribbean
voices. As Sandra Pouchet Paquet writes, ‚ÄúSelf-focus enhances rather
than diminishes authority; it serves to establish the author‚Äôs
credibility in a cultural space of his own creation.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> With their
self-focused writings, Chin and James propelled themselves into a
literary tradition while also wrestling with the myopia of that
tradition. Taking advantage of turn-of-the-twenty-first-century
technologies that promised freedom even as they withheld ultimate
control, Chin and James insisted on the relevance and credibility of
queer and Caribbean and queer Caribbean lives. In this place where they
could write their own histories, they created and deleted, reproduced
and revised, refusing to let their self-narratives be fixed.</p>

      <p>Audre Lorde, acknowledgments to <em>Zami: A New Spelling of My Name</em>

originally been published in 1982 by Persephone Press, which had
also published Cliff‚Äôs <em>Claiming an Identity</em>. I note this as
potential evidence of the difficulties queer writers of color may
have had in gaining, and maintaining, access to publishing their
stories. Persephone was a small independent press specializing in
feminist and lesbian books. The press was short-lived (1976‚Äì83) and,
after publishing fourteen titles, folded because of financial
troubles. In a 1983 interview, Lorde spoke of having to pay for the
rights to republish <em>Zami</em> and criticized Persephone for their
treatment of women writers of color. See Karla Jay, ‚ÄúSpeaking the

usefulness of the concept of supermodernity, as compared to other

idea of exaggeration and the retention of the concept of modernity.
Regarding the first point, Aug√© talks of three excesses: factual
