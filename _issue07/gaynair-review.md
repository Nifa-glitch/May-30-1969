  bio: >
    Dr. Marlene Gaynair is a social and cultural historian of the modern Black Atlantic, with specialization in the United States, Canada, and Anglo Caribbean during the long twentieth century. Her research interests cover twentieth century popular culture, identities, citizenship, diasporas, public memory, immigration, transnational studies, cultural studies, business studies, ethnic groups, Black Feminist Thought, and urban histories and spaces. She is also the architect of “Islands in the North,” an ongoing, interactive, curated digital exhibit (re) creating Black cultural and spatial identities in Toronto. She continues to engage in digital histories and humanities as a way to explore other dimensions of historical scholarship and public engagement. She is currently working on her book manuscript, which is a comparative transnational study of Jamaicans in Toronto and New York City during the twentieth century. Dr. Gaynair uses “infrapolitics” to examine the social, cultural, and political building of community institutions in both major cities, and how Jamaicans in the diaspora challenged what it meant to be “Black”, “American”, and “Canadian” on a global scale.

A 4x4 grid of images of portraits, artwork, and videos of the global
Haitian experience covers the screen; a white background and black
Gothic type font linger in the margins. In scrolling over each square, a
caption or brief description appears and offers insight into the
selected image. A click on "Go to original post," opens a new window and
reveals an Instagram post with additional pictures, digital content, and
comments. This is the front page of [Rendering Revolution: Sartorial Approaches to Haitian History.](https://renderingrevolution.ht/)

According to its about page, the website is "a queer, bilingual,
feminist experiment in digital interdisciplinary scholarship that uses
the lens of fashion and material culture to trace the aesthetic, social,
and political reverberations of the Haitian Revolution as a
world-historical moment." The link attached to "a world-historical
moment," takes you to an *aeon* article by Laurent Dubois, a historian
of Haitian history at the University of Virginia, which argues that
"Haiti, not the US or France, was where the assertion of human rights
reached its defining climax in the Age of Revolution." Using
Dubois' argument for recentering the importance of this historic freedom
struggle, Rendering Revolution "explores the many ways in
which modern identities (and concepts such as human rights) were formed
in relation to the legacy of slavery in the Americas." The site
authors do this through their curation and translation
of the material artifacts and intellectual
contributions of "occluded figures" in history, particularly
women and members of the LGBTQI+ community. Significantly, on
this about page and throughout the website, everything is published in
both English and in Haitian Creole, with the latter presented in light
blue font. Rendering Revolution thus pointedly centers speakers and
readers of Haitian Creole and reminds us that a digital archive of
Haitian history must be accessible to everyone of the Haitian diaspora,
especially those who are or have been traditionally excluded from the
archives.

Siobhan Meï and Jonathan Michael Square are co-founders of Rendering
Revolution. It is clear, however, that the site is a broadly
collaborative effort, as is evidenced by its practice of citation and
acknowledgment. The user encounters the names of contributors
like fashion designer and activist Stella Jean, drag king Mildred
"Dred" Gerestant, and feminist performer-activist-scholar, Gina Athena
Ulysse. Under the Network menu, there are expansive biographies of
co-founders Meï and Square, in addition to that of Danielle M. Dorvil, a
PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University; Nathan H. Dize, a teacher,
scholar, and translator of Haitian and Francophone Caribbean literature;
Nicole Willson, a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow in the Institute
for Black Atlantic Research at the University of Central Lancashire; Kai
Toussaint Marcel, researcher for the curatorial department; and Mirline
Pierre, an editor and instructor of Haitian Literature and Francophone
studies. Noticeably, the biography of Dieulermesson Petit Frère, a poet,
writer, and French language and literature professor, is published in
Haitian Creole. This forces or, rather, encourages the reader
to translate the words into English (or another language), if they are
not able to read Creole, a reversal of the common experience that many
non-English readers are obliged to face. The co-founders of
Rendering Revolution fully embrace this kind of
revolutionary scholarship and curatorial practice and they have
worked to create spaces for others to do the same.

Rendering Revolution proposes five menu items: About,
Contact, Exhibition, Network, and Syllabus. While the Contact and
Network menus present Meï and Square's biographies and contact
information, as well as those of the other major contributors
to the digital archive, the Syllabus section
reveals a truly fascinating side of the site's
revolutionary intention. Described as "A collection of sources
and stories that speak to the importance of dress, fashion, materiality,
and adornment to visions of freedom before, during, and after the
Haitian Revolution," this syllabus focuses on the Haitian Revolution and
its afterlives through the lens of fashion, in order to examine and
analyze the "local and global legacies of the Haitian Revolution in
novel and productive ways." Under headings like "Archival Documents,"
"Clothing, Decorative Objects, and Other Material References,"
"Ethnographic Engravings," "Portraits," and "Travelers' Accounts,"
hyperlinks take the user throughout the Haitian diaspora, past,
present, and future. For instance, under the "Films" heading, a click on
"Toussaint Louverture, Phillipe Niang (2012)" opens another window to
the IMDb page of a television miniseries about the formally enslaved
general, leader, and hero of the Haitian Revolution. When one clicks on
"Daveed Baptiste" under the Rendering Revolution exclusive interview
heading, a window opens to the site's official [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/p/CN7VUUMFW-w/),
which features samples of the Haitian-American artist series, "Haiti to
Hood." Not only can the user see Baptiste's work outside of the museums
and art galleries in which it has been featured, but the site's creators
have also included a penetrating interview with the artist. The syllabus
is taken beyond the classroom and made accessible to all who come to
this digital archive. The Rendering Revolution syllabus continues the
work of decolonizing and building archives and traditional academic
knowledge production by proposing a course of study that presents a
diverse array of cultural artifacts, languages, and modes of expression
from within Haiti and its wide diaspora.

While the Exhibition is under construction, the entirety of Rendering
Revolution's digital project is a masterclass in the possibilities of
digital humanities. The website is intuitive and easy to use for most
internet users. A quick click on the black and white circular logo will
always bring you back home to the constantly upgraded grid of the site's
Instagram feed. Users can also click on the recognizable Facebook and
Twitter icons, to engage with the conversations taking place on those
popular social media spaces. For the moment, this website features the
curatorial posts on their Instagram account, also reproduced on their
Facebook and Twitter accounts, and their curated collection of stories
and sources in their syllabus. As written under the Exhibition section,
"We are in the early stages of curating an exhibition inspired by the
work that we do at Rendering Revolution. More to come here soon," and as
a visitor, one hopes they do not make us wait too long.

One of the best reasons to come back to this website again and again is
that it is an ongoing digital compendium of the Haitian experience in a
digital space. It was built to be a living accessible document, and one
of its goals is to center the contributions of individuals, as
Michel-Rolph Trouillot said, "who have unequal access to the means for
such production." It is unlike anywhere and anything else on the
internet, and a necessary, welcomed intervention and contribution to the
digital humanities field. As a collaborative, interactive, digital
interdisciplinary project, with a focus on queer, bilingual, feminist
expressions of fashion and material culture, Rendering Revolution
provides an expansive look at the Haitian diasporic world, past,
present, and futures.
