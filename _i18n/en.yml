  subtitle: "a journal of Caribbean digital praxis"
  blurb:
    "<em>archipelagos</em> is a born-digital, peer-reviewed publication devoted to creative exploration, debate, and critical thinking about and through digital practices in contemporary scholarly and artistic work in and on the Caribbean. Given the wide implications of the “digital turn” for our very conceptions of knowledge, our mission is to discern the ways in which the digital may enhance and transform our comprehension of the regional and diasporic Caribbean. <em>archipelagos</em> responds to this challenge with three distinct dimensions of critical production: scholarly essays; digital scholarship projects; and digital project reviews."

  dloc-intro-text: "The essays in this special issue of <em>archipelagos journal</em> are dedicated to the towering work of the Digital Library of the Caribbean. Our guest editors for this issue are Perry Collins and Hadassah St. Hubert"
  iei-intro-text: "After 21 years of rich and sustained activity, the landmark Caribbean digital project <a href='https://ile-en-ile.org/index.html' target='_blank'>île-en-île</a> ceased production. At <em>archipelagos journal</em> we wanted to honor the two decades of pioneering editorial work of Thomas Spear, and the many contributions of *île-en-île* to our field, by doing two things: First, we helped Thomas implement several archival strategies for the site; and second, we invited several scholars and educators to reflect on the impact of the site on our teaching and research. Below are their reflections."
