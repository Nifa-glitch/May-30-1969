_issue01/scott-learning.md:consider the implications of the “digital turn” for scholarly production
_issue02/monroe-review.md:Frederick Douglass’s account provides a rare window into the everyday lives of many enslaved Africans in the New World, lives that were consumed by the grueling demands of plantation labor but were also filled with everyday domestic realities.[^1] Historical sources are often silent on such aspects of slave life, and those seeking to tease out these hidden histories often engage with a variety of source material. Written accounts, plantation ledgers, slave narratives, oral traditions, music, folklore, and more are standard “go-to” resources for uncovering the subtle contours of slave life in the past. In the past few decades, archaeological evidence has increasingly entered the conversation, providing a valuable new archive for studying the materiality of slavery in the past. This evidence sometimes corroborates, often counters, and always agitates dominant narratives about slave societies in the New World, and the archaeological study of slavery has expanded significantly since the first excavations were undertaken in slave quarters decades ago.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:Since 2000, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, Jillian Galle and Fraser Neiman of the Monticello Department of Archaeology have led an initiative to rectify this issue. Their efforts have resulted in the [Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery](https://www.daacs.org/), a relational PostgreSQL online database designed to synthesize available archaeological datasets from the Southeast and the Caribbean and to make these data accessible to the public. As the site creators note, the primary goal of DAACS is “to foster inter-site, comparative archaeological research that will advance our historical understanding of the slavery-based societies that evolved in the Atlantic World during the early-modern era.”[^3] DAACS is becoming increasingly visible in the archaeological community, driving change in the way archaeologists think about teaching and researching slavery in the New World.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:The DAACS site is organized hierarchically. The [home page](https://www.daacs.org/) provides a visually attractive gateway to the site, with a running list of tabs placed along the top, each linking to more specific lines of inquiry. Additionally, a number of prominently displayed features on the home page provide direct links to information of interest to a general audience. One takes you to the “[About DAACS](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035144/https://www.daacs.org/aboutdaacs/)” page, which provides useful contextual information about the history and goals of the project as well as participants and institutional partners. Another directs the visitor to the “[Galleries](https://www.daacs.org/research/galleries/)” page (under “Research”), which includes links to a highlights of artifact assemblages from a subset of sites included in the archive. For the novice in archaeology, these are excellent starting points. Here one can find an overview of DAACS history and goals and gain an appreciation for the range of artifacts recovered from plantation sites, before digging deeper into the database.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:If your interests rest primarily in gaining a broad, qualitative appreciation for specific sites, the “[Archaeological Sites](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035155/https://www.daacs.org/archaeological-sites-map/)” tab on the home page will take you to a comprehensive list of excavations included in DAACS. Clicking on any particular excavation, you will be taken to an archaeological map of the site, with links to general information about excavation history and methods, lists of archaeological features, and a discussion of the chronology of features, as well as a comprehensive set of photographs and bibliographic references. This information will be particularly helpful for gaining a general knowledge of a site, locating references to the archaeological contexts, or just getting a sense of the features one might use for further comparative analysis.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:If you are interested in digging much deeper into the data, the “[Query the Database](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035202/https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/)” tab on the home page will take you to a set of “queries” that allow you to extract specific information about one site, or a group of sites, located in DAACS. A [context query](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/context-queries/) will produce information on all of the archaeological contexts and features excavated in the sites selected. In contrast, an [artifact query](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/artifact-queries/) will yield finds lists for the site(s) selected, allowing you to quantify patterns within a site or compare the relative frequencies of different kinds of artifacts between sites. Such queries, for example, allow you to determine whether enslaved Africans at one site consumed wild foods or utilized locally produced cooking pots to a greater degree than those at another, questions with important implications for our comparative understanding of the economy and culture of slave sites. Furthermore, other queries can be run to locate primary documents about sites, explore site chronology, or retrieve artifact images.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:A number of additional features render DAACS an invaluable resource for both research and teaching. First, under the “[About the Database](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035207/https://www.daacs.org/about-the-database/)” tab are located a series of manuals and guides for cataloguing artifacts, information on how the database was structured, and instructions on interpreting and using DAACS data. Second, under the “[Research](https://www.daacs.org/research/)” tab, the creators have provided a comprehensive bibliography of conference presentations, publications, and theses that have used DAACS data, as well as a bibliography of source material for the sites presented. Third, the “[Syllabi and Workshops Handouts](https://www.daacs.org/research/workshops/)” page (also under the “Research” tab) contains useful lists of datasets, syllabi, and teaching modules provided by teaching professionals at DAACS and from universities across the country. These are mostly geared toward a university-level audience with some basic skills in quantitative analysis; however, they could be easily modified to suit a more general audience.

_issue02/introduction.md:Our second section, "Digital Projects," features the public peer review of the digital cartography site *Ramble Bahamas: A Project by “From Dat Time."* Presented with feedback on both the form and content of their platform, site authors Jessica Dawson and Tracey Thompson responded generously and thoroughly to the *sx archipelagos* reviewer's queries and critiques, clarifying and streamlining elements of their site and providing an insightful written account of the site's logic and intentions. The second essay in this section, Angela Sutton's "The Digital Overhaul of the Archive of Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies (ESSSS)," breaks new ground for us. With this submission we opened up the "Digital Projects" section to the *inventio* genre—often called "project narratives" or "progress narratives"—familiar to digital humanities audiences. In her essay, Sutton opens a window onto the infrastructural, labor, and intellectual concerns behind a digital archive project.
_issue03/daut.md:abstract: "In the spirit of Papa Legba (a Haitian <em>lwa</em> who is the arbiter of the crossroads between the human and nonhuman worlds), this essay examines the challenges and opportunities presented when using a digital humanities approach to archiving early Haitian sovereignty, a critical but often forgotten part of the story of the making of the modern world-system. Abdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd have written about “archival work, as a form of counter-memory” that is “essential to the critical articulation of minority discourse.” However, because archives, like other kinds of texts, reflect the worldview of their creators, the archivist working to articulate “minority discourse” must be careful not to reproduce patterns of domination or cultural exploitation. For Haiti, this means that we must work against the idea that the abundant historical resources now made readily (and often freely) available by various digitization projects, represent a “new frontier” for research, an idea that encourages the notion that the country is “open for business” on a variety of levels. Instead, by using the metaphor of the crossroads, this essay demonstrates how a multimodal approach—involving content, context, collaboration, and access—can allow for alternative ways of (humanely) archiving black sovereignty."
_issue03/daut.md:Robert Lawless has called “Haiti’s bad press,” on the one hand, and the

_issue03/daut.md:especially when it contains what Joel Dreyfuss has aptly called “the

_issue03/daut.md:generating “new narratives” in order to combat what Ulysse has referred

_issue03/daut.md:“relationship, the codependency even, between on the one hand, the
_issue03/daut.md:other hand, the questions that we ask.” Benedicty continues, “What is

_issue03/daut.md:uses the concept of the “counter-plantation,” derived from the readings
_issue03/daut.md:precisely to ask questions about “how Haitians have survived, subsisted,

_issue03/daut.md:“better objects”—Haitian-produced objects—into my archive and to ask
_issue03/daut.md:“better questions,” namely, how did the early sovereign period of
_issue03/daut.md:“Unexploited Sources for the History of the Haitian Revolution,” an
_issue03/daut.md:article which focused on describing the “vast quantity of neglected
_issue03/daut.md:United States\] that concerns” what he calls “this unique and profound
_issue03/daut.md:event.”[^24] Archival recovery work of the stripe that Geggus promoted
_issue03/daut.md:“Archival work,” Abdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd have written, “\[is\]
_issue03/daut.md:of minority discourse.”[^26] However, because archives, like the texts
_issue03/daut.md:archive.org) indicate that Haiti represents “history’s new frontier” for
_issue03/daut.md:research.[^27] Seeing Haiti as a “frontier” not only calls forth the
_issue03/daut.md:notion that the country is “open for business.” An open-for-business
_issue03/daut.md:equally in the “buildings, dead bodies, censuses, \[and\] monuments” as
_issue03/daut.md:it was in “diaries and political boundaries.”[^30] Such an idea is

_issue03/daut.md:documents.[^33] In “Unexploited Sources,” Geggus had warned researchers
_issue03/daut.md:even colonial Saint-Domingue in Haiti. “Paradoxically, but
_issue03/daut.md:understandably enough,” he wrote, “Haiti itself seems to possess no
_issue03/daut.md:contains no documents from the colonial period.”[^34] Julia Gaffield,
_issue03/daut.md:United States, has also observed that because the “collections \[in
_issue03/daut.md:twentieth century,” her research on the “early years of Haitian
_issue03/daut.md:independence could not be based exclusively on research in Haiti.”[^35]
_issue03/daut.md:mission. “I once again appeal to the authorities of the country,”
_issue03/daut.md:Tardieu wrote in the Haitian newspaper *Le Nouvelliste*. “A cultural

_issue03/daut.md:“been removed from the Admiralty records and re-cataloged as a map so
_issue03/daut.md:that it would not have to be folded in the bound volume.” She concludes,
_issue03/daut.md:therefore, “This second discovery emphasized one of the key explanations
_issue03/daut.md:in unexpected archival locations.”[^42]
_issue03/daut.md:one document digitized by DLOC is titled “[La désignation des postes
_issue03/daut.md:Domingue](http://dloc.com/CA00510270/00001?search=revolution)”; another
_issue03/daut.md:wished them not to encourage the “Columbusing” of Haitian-produced
_issue03/daut.md:“something that is not new.”[^47] Thus we might say that the RSHHGG Lab

_issue03/daut.md:The “citizen historian” model of digital history projects has been
_issue03/daut.md:actual citizen history versus crowdsourcing requires “build\[ing\] a

_issue03/daut.md:writes, “that there is a need for broader access to Dessalines’s texts
_issue03/daut.md:(both positive and negative) to the Age of Revolutions.”[^54] The
_issue03/daut.md:historian archivists can have is to use the internet to “digitally

_issue03/daut.md:curation. The “Digital Humanities Manifesto” (version 2.0) introduces
_issue03/daut.md:English and Kreyòl of “key primary sources” in French held by the
_issue03/daut.md:eighteenth-century “dealing with the grain shortage faced by the colony
_issue03/daut.md:of Saint-Domingue in 1789.” Editors Kelsey Corlett Rivera, Abby
_issue03/daut.md:Broughton, and Nathan Dize note that “alongside the French original,

_issue03/daut.md:would ensure that all of Haiti’s “annals would be conserved and
_issue03/daut.md:transmitted by its proper citizens” and would underscore the importance
_issue03/daut.md:of “preventing \[Haiti’s\] history from being forgotten.”[^68]

_issue03/nesbitt.md:abstract: "The essay interrogates C. L. R. James’s famous claim in *The* *Black Jacobins* (1938) that the slaves of St. Domingue were “closer to a modern proletariat than any group of workers in existence at the time,” by comparing James’s understanding of the concept *proletariat*—there and in *World Revolution* (1937)—with Marx’s various developments of the concept across the three volumes of *Capital*. This analysis distinguishes James’s political and historicist deployment of the term from Marx’s analytical usage of the notion in his categorial critique of capitalism. In contrast with James’s linear, Marxist-humanist understanding of the passage from slavery to capitalism, Marx defines these two basic categories in *Capital* as analytically (as opposed to historically) distinct modes of production. The essay thus concludes by analyzing Marx’s conceptual differentiation of slavery and industrial capitalism in *Capital*, drawing on Etienne Balibar’s analysis of the concepts of mode of production and transition in *Reading Capital* (1965)."

_issue03/nesbitt.md:“struggle of economic forces for their full expansion was translated, as
_issue03/nesbitt.md:organisation of society.”[^10] In this context, James continues, there
_issue03/nesbitt.md:appeared “a new class,” one that,
_issue03/nesbitt.md:working conditions (“forced to combine industrially and ultimately
_issue03/nesbitt.md:politically”), and by what James calls “the increasing pressure upon

_issue03/nesbitt.md:famous invocation in the *Communist Manifesto* to “Proletarians of all
_issue03/nesbitt.md:countries!,” in which proletarians are those who “have nothing to lose
_issue03/nesbitt.md:but their chains.”[^15] In this most famous early text—written before

_issue03/nesbitt.md:being, in James’s words, “closer to a modern proletariat,” but is rather

_issue03/nesbitt.md:right: “I give them to you, dear Comrade, and authorize you to sell
_issue03/nesbitt.md:them; they are my property.”[^30] Correspondingly, as property, slaves

_issue03/nesbitt.md:    *Capital*. The one exception is his 1967 talk “Marx’s *Capital*, the
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    Working-day, and Capitalist Production,” in which James discusses
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    the duration of the working day: “\[Marx\] is concerned with what is
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    a factory.” C. L. R. James, *You Don’t Play with Revolution: The
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    study of Hegel’s *Logic*. Grace Lee Boggs observed in 1947, “As soon

_issue03/nesbitt.md:[^17]: Two of Marx’s many citations gleaned from Capital, vol. 1: “One
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    withdraws from their pockets” (Sismondi, qtd. on 207); “The
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    share in the product” (Charbuliez, qtd. on 718). J. C. L. Simonde de

_issue03/nesbitt.md:    “labor-power,” it is hardly surprising that this should be the case
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    such as “proletariat.” Moreover, here I am only considering the
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    conceptualization of the “proletariat” in the voluminous editions,
_issue03/nesbitt.md:[^19]: “The other classes decay and disappear in the face of large-scale
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    industry, the proletariat is its most characteristic product” (Marx,
_issue03/nesbitt.md:[^20]: “The workers have been turned into proletarians, and their means
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    stands on its own feet” (Marx, *Capital*, 1:928).

_issue03/nesbitt.md:    “reserve army,” one willing and indeed forced subsequently to take
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    Italian case: “In Italy, where capitalist production developed
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    found a master ready and waiting for him in the towns” (*Capital*,

_issue03/nesbitt.md:    (“capitalist modernity”), continues to put forth the question of the
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    concept of combined and uneven development, see Bill Schwarz, “Haiti
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    and Historical Time,” in Forsdick and Høgsbjorg, “The Black
_issue03/nesbitt.md:    Jacobins” Reader, 99–102. On uneven development, see Bruno Bosteels,

On the concept of Left Ricardianism—that is, the failure to clearly distinguish wealth from value and the consequent promotion of the redistribution of that wealth rather than the destruction of the capitalist mode of production—see Patrick Murray, “The Illusion of the Economic: The Trinity Formula and the ‘Religion of Everyday Life,’” in Martha Campbell and Geert Reuten, eds., *The Culmination of Capital: Essays on Volume III of Marx’s Capital* (New York: Palgrave 2002), 250–52.

submission-guidelines.md:*Markdown (.md)*: Publishing is in many ways a game of file conversions. Both our website and PDFs are built from the same Markdown files. While we gladly accept articles in Office format, we encourage our authors to submit plain text files (UTF-8 encoding), written using [Kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html), a version of Markdown, and saved with the .md extension. This will help us keep our workflow light and our file types closer to the production line, contributing in turn to our continued ownership of all aspects of journal production. For some background on our infrastructural choices, and to get started with Markdown, please take some time to read “[Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown),” by Dennis Tenen and Grant Whytoff. We sincerely appreciate those who accept the challenge of changing their work habits and are happy to provide assistance during the process. You will find many markdown editing tools available, and most plain text editors are great at handling markdown.
submission-guidelines.md:-   Please identify the components of your article—such as headings (“Heading 2” is a major divider; “Heading 3” is subordinate to Heading 2, etc.), epigraphs, excerpts, and captions—to avoid confusion.
submission-guidelines.md:-   Avoid contractions such as “isn’t,” “aren’t,” and “didn’t,” which seem casual in an academic journal.
submission-guidelines.md:-   Use “scare quotes” sparingly to highlight a word for emphasis or irony, per *CMS* 7.58. See Emphasis below.
submission-guidelines.md:-   Spell out “e.g.” and “i.e.” in running text; may be used in parenthetical text, followed by a comma.
submission-guidelines.md:-   Do not include “Ltd.,” “Inc.,” or “Co.” in publisher names.
submission-guidelines.md:-   Shortened references to capitalized entities are lowercased. For example, “The Labour Party did such-and-such. Later, the party continued to influence such-and-such.”
submission-guidelines.md:-   For a quote in running text, cap the first word in the quotation when it is set off with a verb of speech or of writing (As X explains \[remarked, said, wrote\], “When . . .”). Do not cap if syntactical part of sentence and preceded by a conjunction (X explains that “when . . .”).
submission-guidelines.md:-   In quotations, added emphasis must be distinguished from emphasis in original. In a footnote: after page number, add “emphasis mine” or “italics in original” in parenthesis. In in-text citation: “quoted material *running* in the text ends here” (119; emphasis mine) \[or, (119; italics in original)\]. If adding emphasis to text that already has italics in it, indicate your italics with brackets: “quoted material *running in* \[emphasis mine\] the text *ends here*.”
submission-guidelines.md:-   When using a word ironically, use quotation marks to set it off: distinguishing between “true” and “false” religion. Note that using “so-called” eliminates the need for quotation marks: in a “civilized” society; but, in a so-called civilized society.
submission-guidelines.md:-   If needed under a figure, provide a number with the caption. In text, refer to a figure as “see figure 1” or “(see fig. 1).”
submission-guidelines.md:-   Arabic numerals and lowercase for chapters, parts, and so on (“in part1,” “after chapter 3”) in running text. For dollars: US\$6000.
submission-guidelines.md:-   “Which” is nonrestrictive (use with a comma); “that” is restrictive.
submission-guidelines.md:When referring to words as the words themselves, use italics to set apart: “the terms *witchcraft* and *magic* became popular . . .”
submission-guidelines.md:-   No comma after short introductory phrases, unless confusion results. Add one after longer phrases and after sentence adverbs (“Thus, . . . .”).
submission-guidelines.md:-   No comma in “not only . . . but” phrases, unless confusion results. No comma after “yet” used at the beginning of a sentence.
submission-guidelines.md:Avoid constructions like “s/he,” “he/she,” and “and/or”
submission-guidelines.md:-   If you use Zotero and are writing your article in Markdown, you can streamline your bibliographic citations in Chicago Style by using the method described in “[Sustainable Authorship](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown).”
submission-guidelines.md:-   Present full citation at first mention in an article; use surname(s) and short title thereafter, or “ibid.” for a sequence of individual repeated references. Exception: If the article is a close reading of one or two literary works, give full citation in a footnote at first mention, with the notation “hereafter cited in text”; if necessary, also introduce an abbreviation for the title that will appear in the in-text citation with the page numbers.
