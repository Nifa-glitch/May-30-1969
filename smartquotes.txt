_issue03/daut.md:abstract: "In the spirit of Papa Legba (a Haitian <em>lwa</em> who is the arbiter of the crossroads between the human and nonhuman worlds), this essay examines the challenges and opportunities presented when using a digital humanities approach to archiving early Haitian sovereignty, a critical but often forgotten part of the story of the making of the modern world-system. Abdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd have written about “archival work, as a form of counter-memory” that is “essential to the critical articulation of minority discourse.” However, because archives, like other kinds of texts, reflect the worldview of their creators, the archivist working to articulate “minority discourse” must be careful not to reproduce patterns of domination or cultural exploitation. For Haiti, this means that we must work against the idea that the abundant historical resources now made readily (and often freely) available by various digitization projects, represent a “new frontier” for research, an idea that encourages the notion that the country is “open for business” on a variety of levels. Instead, by using the metaphor of the crossroads, this essay demonstrates how a multimodal approach—involving content, context, collaboration, and access—can allow for alternative ways of (humanely) archiving black sovereignty."
_issue03/daut.md:Robert Lawless has called “Haiti’s bad press,” on the one hand, and the
_issue03/daut.md:resonant, opposing concept of “new narratives,” called for by scholars
_issue03/daut.md:understand the meaning of “bad press” for Haiti when we see it,
_issue03/daut.md:especially when it contains what Joel Dreyfuss has aptly called “the
_issue03/daut.md:phrase.”[^2] It is much less clear, however, how we might go about
_issue03/daut.md:generating “new narratives” in order to combat what Ulysse has referred
_issue03/daut.md:to as the persistence of “Haiti’s image problem.”[^3] In other words,
_issue03/daut.md:as one of the world’s most important historical figures: “Louverture’s
_issue03/daut.md:emancipation, not least in Haiti itself?”[^4]
_issue03/daut.md:to the *idea* of Toussaint in the “European imagination.” Primary real
_issue03/daut.md:McIntosch wondering, “Is the display about the revolutionary legacy of
_issue03/daut.md:Louverture as a revolutionary trope for global black nationalism?”[^6]
_issue03/daut.md:manje*, or, “It is the old pot that makes the best food.”
_issue03/daut.md:called the “Haytian fear.”[^8] Overburdened attention to Atlantic world
_issue03/daut.md:Haitian people as “subjects and agents, as complex human beings with
_issue03/daut.md:life.”[^10]
_issue03/daut.md:ability to, in Karen Salt’s words, “highlight…black politics alongside
_issue03/daut.md:political agency of black bodies.”[^13]
_issue03/daut.md:god of the *kalfou*, or “crossroads” who acts as an arbiter between the
_issue03/daut.md:“opener of gates” and therefore of opportunities. Vodou songs routinely
_issue03/daut.md:implore, “Papa Legba, louvri barrye pou mwen”—open the gate for me. In
_issue03/daut.md:the iconic words of Papa Legba as a title, “Louvri barye.”[^14] This
_issue03/daut.md:slavery, “Why did he liberate the slaves? What could have brought him to
_issue03/daut.md:such a decision?”[^15] For Trouillot, walking through the history of how
_issue03/daut.md:In the introduction Trouillot explains, “In order for us to understand
_issue03/daut.md:kind of diseases course through our blood.”[^16]
_issue03/daut.md:final destination. If “there is no center,”[^17] this is because every
_issue03/daut.md:historians’ conceptions of what I have elsewhere referred to as “[the
_issue03/daut.md:Atlantic](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/ba15390b4fd1e7d29a79c367f2799f1f/transnational-african-american-text-network/draft.html).”[^18]
_issue03/daut.md:examined “how the dead affected the history of the living.”[^19] Now,
_issue03/daut.md:“The archives \[are\] not lacking, but they created a void and emptiness
_issue03/daut.md:combing through them.”[^21] Alessandra Benedicty, evoking the works of
_issue03/daut.md:“relationship, the codependency even, between on the one hand, the
_issue03/daut.md:other hand, the questions that we ask.” Benedicty continues, “What is
_issue03/daut.md:human condition.”[^22]
_issue03/daut.md:uses the concept of the “counter-plantation,” derived from the readings
_issue03/daut.md:precisely to ask questions about “how Haitians have survived, subsisted,
_issue03/daut.md:participation on their part.”[^23] His thesis, in effect, is that the
_issue03/daut.md:“better objects”—Haitian-produced objects—into my archive and to ask
_issue03/daut.md:“better questions,” namely, how did the early sovereign period of
_issue03/daut.md:“Unexploited Sources for the History of the Haitian Revolution,” an
_issue03/daut.md:article which focused on describing the “vast quantity of neglected
_issue03/daut.md:United States\] that concerns” what he calls “this unique and profound
_issue03/daut.md:event.”[^24] Archival recovery work of the stripe that Geggus promoted
_issue03/daut.md:“Archival work,” Abdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd have written, “\[is\]
_issue03/daut.md:of minority discourse.”[^26] However, because archives, like the texts
_issue03/daut.md:archive.org) indicate that Haiti represents “history’s new frontier” for
_issue03/daut.md:research.[^27] Seeing Haiti as a “frontier” not only calls forth the
_issue03/daut.md:notion that the country is “open for business.” An open-for-business
_issue03/daut.md:equally in the “buildings, dead bodies, censuses, \[and\] monuments” as
_issue03/daut.md:it was in “diaries and political boundaries.”[^30] Such an idea is
_issue03/daut.md:*ou, Révélations des lieux et des monuments historiques*, “Persuaded
_issue03/daut.md:monuments and places.”[^31] Throughout the body of the work, Dumesle
_issue03/daut.md:“monuments,” as equally as the very land itself, to provide him with
_issue03/daut.md:sources for telling the story of Haitian history: “Stones, mountains,
_issue03/daut.md:and valleys, oh how your echoes resound!”[^32] 
_issue03/daut.md:documents.[^33] In “Unexploited Sources,” Geggus had warned researchers
_issue03/daut.md:even colonial Saint-Domingue in Haiti. “Paradoxically, but
_issue03/daut.md:understandably enough,” he wrote, “Haiti itself seems to possess no
_issue03/daut.md:contains no documents from the colonial period.”[^34] Julia Gaffield,
_issue03/daut.md:United States, has also observed that because the “collections \[in
_issue03/daut.md:twentieth century,” her research on the “early years of Haitian
_issue03/daut.md:independence could not be based exclusively on research in Haiti.”[^35]
_issue03/daut.md:mission. “I once again appeal to the authorities of the country,”
_issue03/daut.md:Tardieu wrote in the Haitian newspaper *Le Nouvelliste*. “A cultural
_issue03/daut.md:archives of London? Only an official mission will tell.”[^39]
_issue03/daut.md:“been removed from the Admiralty records and re-cataloged as a map so
_issue03/daut.md:that it would not have to be folded in the bound volume.” She concludes,
_issue03/daut.md:therefore, “This second discovery emphasized one of the key explanations
_issue03/daut.md:in unexpected archival locations.”[^42]
_issue03/daut.md:one document digitized by DLOC is titled “[La désignation des postes
_issue03/daut.md:Domingue](http://dloc.com/CA00510270/00001?search=revolution)”; another
_issue03/daut.md:wished them not to encourage the “Columbusing” of Haitian-produced
_issue03/daut.md:“something that is not new.”[^47] Thus we might say that the RSHHGG Lab
_issue03/daut.md:variation, perhaps, of the “citizen historian” model?
_issue03/daut.md:The “citizen historian” model of digital history projects has been
_issue03/daut.md:actual citizen history versus crowdsourcing requires “build\[ing\] a
_issue03/daut.md:critical mass of discussion and usage” while “expos\[ing\] people to
_issue03/daut.md:historical materials that are potentially interesting.” However, Ridge
_issue03/daut.md:therefore not be hidden away. She calls for “crowdsourcing and citizen
_issue03/daut.md:use”: “Signing up to a project and doing a bit of transcription work
_issue03/daut.md:rather than, perhaps, a citizen transcriber.”[^50] Without a doubt,
_issue03/daut.md:to “help...make historical documents and biodiversity data more
_issue03/daut.md:accessible.”[^51] Volunteer transcribers are working to “decipher
_issue03/daut.md:iconic artists to early U.S. currency.”[^52] Digitizing an extensive
_issue03/daut.md:prime example of the possibilities that “sharing” by historian
_issue03/daut.md:this reader online: “Recently, I proposed \[to a publisher\] a volume of
_issue03/daut.md:question of authorship. This response has renewed my conviction,” she
_issue03/daut.md:writes, “that there is a need for broader access to Dessalines’s texts
_issue03/daut.md:(both positive and negative) to the Age of Revolutions.”[^54] The
_issue03/daut.md:historian archivists can have is to use the internet to “digitally
_issue03/daut.md:repatriate” documents that no longer live where they were born.[^55]
_issue03/daut.md:curation. The “Digital Humanities Manifesto” (version 2.0) introduces
_issue03/daut.md:English and Kreyòl of “key primary sources” in French held by the
_issue03/daut.md:eighteenth-century “dealing with the grain shortage faced by the colony
_issue03/daut.md:of Saint-Domingue in 1789.” Editors Kelsey Corlett Rivera, Abby
_issue03/daut.md:Broughton, and Nathan Dize note that “alongside the French original,
_issue03/daut.md:particular pamphlet fits into the episode.”[^58] The editors have also
_issue03/daut.md:of the project can help us to suspect the kind of “knowledge” that these
_issue03/daut.md:“Response from the Deputies and Manufacturers…,” dated 13 September
_issue03/daut.md:1789, for example, refutes the idea that there was a “famine” or
_issue03/daut.md:“shortage” of food in the colony at all, and the pamphlet’s authors
_issue03/daut.md:“given the violence enacted against black women’s histories, bodies, and
_issue03/daut.md:production,” whereas Barbara Bush avers, “History has been written for
_issue03/daut.md:men, by men, and thus records only what men wish to see.”[^60] In turn,
_issue03/daut.md:révolution et des guerres civiles d’Hayti* (1819) by stating, “Haiti
_issue03/daut.md:they never seem to be able to abandon….”[^61]
_issue03/daut.md:against enslaved Africans by stating, “We are still afraid of being
_issue03/daut.md:human.”[^64]
_issue03/daut.md:If it is imperative that we suspect the kind of “knowledge” and
_issue03/daut.md:“visitors,” as Louis Joseph Janvier would later call them.[^65] The
_issue03/daut.md:longer do so. “The fact of inhabiting today the country where they once
_issue03/daut.md:lived,” he wrote, “requires us, more than anyone else, to inquire into
_issue03/daut.md:our predecessors.”[^66] Nau was careful, however, to acknowledge that
_issue03/daut.md:would ensure that all of Haiti’s “annals would be conserved and
_issue03/daut.md:transmitted by its proper citizens” and would underscore the importance
_issue03/daut.md:of “preventing \[Haiti’s\] history from being forgotten.”[^68]
_issue03/daut.md:creators of our “sources” are no longer living does not absolve us of
_issue03/daut.md:that end, “Oh, you young Haitians who have had the good fortune to have
_issue03/daut.md:defy and hate your enemies.”[^69] A framework of sovereign defiance
_issue03/daut.md:Frances Smith Foster has called “the lone fugitive,…the singular
_issue03/daut.md:sojourner, or the inspired visionary.”[^71] Working collaboratively
_issue03/daut.md:*Men anpil, chay pa lou*. This Haitian proverb roughly means, “With many
_issue03/daut.md:hands, the burden is not heavy.” We say in English, “Many hands lighten
_issue03/daut.md:the load.” One of the most important Haitian digital humanities
_issue03/daut.md:the process by which it came into being exactly as “truly a grand
_issue03/daut.md:konbit.” Contributors to the site include a variety of US- and
_issue03/daut.md:as graduate students. The site, which “combines rare books, manuscripts,
_issue03/daut.md:States,” also contains “commentary by over one hundred (100) authors
_issue03/daut.md:from universities around the world.”[^73] This project has provided a
_issue03/daut.md:columns, “To the First Monarch Crowned in the New World.”[^78]
_issue03/daut.md:Africans and the government’s subsequent release of 145 “unfortunate
_issue03/daut.md:brothers, victims of greed and the odious traffic in human flesh.”[^79]
_issue03/daut.md:writer tells us that “satisfaction was the same everywhere the prince
_issue03/daut.md:give the prince testaments of their love.” Christophe is barely
_issue03/daut.md:article in question finishes by declaring that the prince is a “worthy
_issue03/daut.md:inheritor of the name and the throne of Henry.”[^80] Because Christophe
_issue03/daut.md:elements in this attempt to create a decolonial archive. “Decolonizing
_issue03/daut.md:the university,” Achille Mbembe has written, “starts with the
_issue03/daut.md:shared between equals.”[^82] Though Mbembe was talking quite literally
_issue03/daut.md:with a form of “*lakou* consciousness” that moves us away from a logic
_issue03/daut.md:Port-au-Prince and a formidable scholar in his own right, “for his
_issue03/daut.md:archives.” “If he had,” Nicholls writes, “I would probably have been
_issue03/daut.md:have been finished.”[^84] Trouillot placed an immediate obstacle of
_issue03/daut.md:when we study the history of early Haiti. “And the museums,” Aimé
_issue03/daut.md:Césaire reminds us, “it would have been better not to have needed
_issue03/daut.md:never weigh so much as one spark of human sympathy.”[^86] One way to
_issue03/daut.md:us all to recognize that we are “direct descendant\[s\] of Prospero
_issue03/daut.md:acts in this moment, but which must always remain open.”[^87]

_issue03/nesbitt.md:abstract: "The essay interrogates C. L. R. James’s famous claim in *The* *Black Jacobins* (1938) that the slaves of St. Domingue were “closer to a modern proletariat than any group of workers in existence at the time,” by comparing James’s understanding of the concept *proletariat*—there and in *World Revolution* (1937)—with Marx’s various developments of the concept across the three volumes of *Capital*. This analysis distinguishes James’s political and historicist deployment of the term from Marx’s analytical usage of the notion in his categorial critique of capitalism. In contrast with James’s linear, Marxist-humanist understanding of the passage from slavery to capitalism, Marx defines these two basic categories in *Capital* as analytically (as opposed to historically) distinct modes of production. The essay thus concludes by analyzing Marx’s conceptual differentiation of slavery and industrial capitalism in *Capital*, drawing on Etienne Balibar’s analysis of the concepts of mode of production and transition in *Reading Capital* (1965)."

_issue03/nesbitt.md:“struggle of economic forces for their full expansion was translated, as
_issue03/nesbitt.md:organisation of society.”[^10] In this context, James continues, there
_issue03/nesbitt.md:appeared “a new class,” one that,

_issue03/nesbitt.md:politically”), and by what James calls “the increasing pressure upon

_issue03/nesbitt.md:but their chains.”[^15] In this most famous early text—written before

_issue03/nesbitt.md:right: “I give them to you, dear Comrade, and authorize you to sell

_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>Breaking, Dancing, Making in the Machine: Notes on .break .danceMarisa Parham“The Caribbean machine, on the other hand, is flow and interruption at once; it is an absolute machine, a meta-machine, which cannot be diagrammed and whose user's manual may be found scattered among its own network of codes… In any event, the notion of polyrhythm (rhythms cut through by other rhythms which are cut by still other rhythms)— if it takes us to the point at which the central rhythm is displaced by other rhythms in such a way as to make it fix a center no longer, then to transcend into a state of flux— may fairly define the type of performance that characterizes the Caribbean cultural machine.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:In the following narrative, I want to share some of the process work behind .break .dance, a digital project I am piloting. .break .dance is what I refer to elsewhere as a research pocket. Each pocket is a thought exercise, as I look for forms that will help me better corral and interpret content. It is part of a constellation of projects by myself and other irlH members, and across projects we have been interested in matters of time, space, and digital experience, looking at a diverse range of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx texts situated across the Americas. Structurally, the project extends a series of conceptualizations: notions of asymmetrical articulation as set forth by Zora Neale Hurston in “Characteristics of Negro Expression,” Antonio Benítez-Rojo’s description of the modern Caribbean as being historically constituted as a series of vast interlocking machines, and Kwame Dawe’s 2012 poem “Stop Time.” .break .dance also of course draws a sense of kinship and belonging from the work collectively understood as Black Code Studies, as set forth by Jessica Johnson and Mark Anthony Neal.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Coding” in .break .dance is understood as instrument, practice, and heuristic, for thinking about my own and other’s acts of encoding and decoding. The title .break .dance itself bespeaks the work of ontology in basic web development, wherein .x is used to mark classes of representation. A class structures style and behavior, so that a wide range of attributes can be applied to a web element by tagging it with the class. By understanding .break and .dance as classes, I am able to put into relation a range of disparate artifacts, and being so hands-on with my artifacts helps me suss why they call to me.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>“We might say that Caribbean texts are ‘fugitive’ by nature… If we look at the most representative Caribbean texts we see that the discourse of ‘content’ is erased by forms that are non-discursive, circular if you like, which finally come forth as the only vehicles able to lead the reader (and the text) to the plenitude of Being and non-Being, of the here and now together with the oblivious and absent. And so the final page of the text becomes the beginning.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Recursion is a function that delegates the processing of a problem to self-referential, iterative, and diminishing versions of the same function, bounded by an initial value and a terminating base case that are essentially the reminders of external determination acting on the system.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Indeed, in previous essays such as “Sample | Signal | Strobe,” I conceptualize recursion as modality that describes a variety of experiences with digital and collective memory. In “Echoing the Echoes: Technopoetics in Dub,” Louis Chude-Sokei gives us an entry-point into connecting recursivity to Édouard Glissant’s conceptualizations of the rhizomatic:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“It is not to be missed or forgotten that with Glissant there is no retour without detour. There are no roots without that return that constructs roots in the very process of reimagining its/their implications. That return transforms roots with traces of and techniques from its future and allows us to see roots not as a retreat into stability but, as David Scott suggests, as a generator of “new questions and new demands” and new horizons of expectation and possibility.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:In “Sample | Signal | Strobe,” what Chude-Sokei frames above as a matter of what is made possible in acts of return that are in fact openings unto new things, I also conceptualize in relation to what DJ Spooky and others recognize as the foundational status of sampling and remix to Black diasporic culture, our constant recombinatory mathematics of the living:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Al-Jabr, the breaking of the bones— movements, disjunctures, and migrations become sites of renewed emergence; moments become touchstones for larger cycles of losing and remaking meaning, of transformation without restoration, the impossibly fluid flow of the popping and locking body, the DJ using two turntables to disaggregate songs into discrete soundbytes so that they might be used as if they were digital, isolating out samples and breaks so that old texts could be made newly resonant with always present futures. Black lives hearken to the digital because black diasporic existence is a digitizing experience. Transfer, migration, metonymy: the break and the remix persist as both witness and feature of the multiple and continual experiences of forced migration endemic to Afro-diasporic life in the Americas— the Middle Passage, the auction block, the Great Migration— ‘the digital.’”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Behind this also thrums Frances McDonald and Whitney Trettien’s advocacy for the importance of following fragments in “A Threshold is an Opening”:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“The pleasure of creating fragments comes from the dawning realization that, as Eve Sedgwick puts it, ‘[A] sentence may be actually inexhaustible.’ Because we are taught to swallow books whole, we tend to think of individual clauses as mechanical parts that work together to advance a plot or an argument. As a digital scrap, detached ‘from its material form, the sentence-turned- fragment becomes dexterous, sticky, promiscuous. It hurtles itself toward other fragments, combining and recombining to create new relations between and across texts.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Breaking, not just looking for the breach, á la deconstruction, but rather actively looking for ways to enter spaces in-between of states juridical, psychic, emotional, or otherwise, and out of such space, glimpsing freedom. As is always the case, Zora Neale Hurston is incredibly helpful in thinking about how such freedoms are made. In “Characteristics of Negro Expression,” Hurston’s description of the iterative and interactive, and intersubjective dimensions of Black dance performance, which she characterizes as a dancer’s embrace of “dynamic suggestion,” which forces spectators to participate in the performance itself. By attending to the gap between oneself and one’s audience, the dancer is able to elicit out of that gap an experiential imagination of all possible worlds:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“the Negro is restrained, but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests. Since no art ever can express all the variations conceivable, the Negro must be considered the greater artist, his dancing is realistic suggestion, and that is about all a great artist can do.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:In her own mining of what Édouard Glissant would later refer to in The Poetics of Relation as the “clairvoyance of relational poetics,” Hurston identifies how participation itself arises out of gaps between what the mind knows, anticipation, and what will be created anew at the moment of reception. From the club to the basement to any space where bodies and music meet, every rhythm carries and transmits an epistemology, and the audience’s anticipation of the performer’s next move or sound quivers at the edge of prophecy. When the performer’s move makes onlooker’s bodies move, that movement already feels like something known and understood, even as that knowledge comes into being through the newness of the onlooker’s own physical, emotional, or psychic response. This resonates with Julia Kristeva’s critical conceptualizations of intersubjectivity in poetic language, is formally and fiercely theorized in Marlene Nourbese-Phillip’s Zong, is structurally exemplified in Gayl Jones’s Corregidora, and has been brought to broader historical conceptualization by Zora Neal Hurston’s descriptions of how the folk works a kind of cultural magic.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>.break .dance is about making meaning of out of pieces of things—news, media, affects— fragments that come to us from elsewhere. I have been working with this as a larger conceptual framework for the last decade, most recognizably in my first monograph, Haunting and Displacement in African American Literature and Culture. In that project I developed paradigms for haunting, which is a term I give to experiences of knowledge that come to us from other people, times, and places, but that are experienced with the ontological force of personal memory. I have returned to that work recently because haunting is paradigmatically useful for thinking about the affective life of digital experience, and the inherently strange spatio-temporal positionalities that arise out of such experience. In “Sample | Signal | Strobe” I elaborate haunting as a strategy for doing a kind of Black digital humanities work, particularly vis-à-vis the conceptual implications of social media as a conduit for news about Black people’s deaths.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:I mention these projects because .break .dance has become the step between “Sample | Signal | Strobe” and the beginning of the Black Haunts in the Anthropocene project. As I discuss in .break .dance, while working on the Black Haunts project I found that I kept returning to the idea of being haunted by internet experience:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:.break .dance began with a map or, more specifically, a chance encounter with a data visualization. And while my experience of that map soon became the kernel of a larger project about space, temporality, and ecological disaster— Black Haunts in the Anthropocene — that feeling of random and digital encounter stayed with me. What I initially experienced as a complex intermingling of comprehension, apprehension, and agency in internet navigation resonated with what in Haunting and Displacement I previously characterized as the haunted dimensionality of Black diasporic life. For even as the larger orientation of the Black Haunts project is about water and wind and earth, about varieties of backwater blues and parable tales, the experience that transited me to those considerations was about blackness, space, and time, about glitches—errors that reveal structures, and breaks—uncomfortable emergences of pasts and their affects and their rearticulations.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Further, if we indeed accept that different scholars indeed come from different intellectual, cultural, and social places, then how do we take seriously the challenge of representing how people from different communities come to knowledge differently? When is difference understood as difference, rather than merely as wrong, as a glitch in a system? As Lori Emerson frames it in “Glitch Aesthetics,” a glitch helps us to make a
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“radical shift in what counts as an aesthetic object or aesthetic experience and asserts that its disruptiveness (in that a glitch constitutes a moment of dysfunctionality in the computer system) defamiliarizes the slick surface of the hardware/software of the computer and so ideally transforms us into critically minded observers of the underlying workings of the computer.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Following Irisdelia Garcia’s work in the digital vaivén: ghosts, the glitch, and puerto rican embodiment, when considered from a minoritized political position, glitches can be “understood as ‘malfunctions’ that are truly defining.” Taken as a call to look for the moments and spaces wherein the systems that produce our social lives falter, a glitch becomes a powerful digital analog for experiences that might otherwise be understood as haunting and uncanniness. A glitch is what is generated when a signal goes wrong, so in a digital process when rows of code, while processing, unintentionally skip a line, or when a mechanical process misses a beat, generating a new “is.” Glitch aesthetics attend to what is made in such moments, as moments of error, like an unintended breakpoint in a code, also offer forth artistic or interpretive opportunity, a moment of creation in the sense that something new is made, refreshed and referential, and interpretive because something about underlying technical structure is glimpsed in that moment of error, thus also opening a space for modalities of inquiry and contemplative experience Édouard Glissant describes as errant thought. In .break .dance, glitchiness is used as an aesthetic strategy that bears on the presentation of content and the limits of such presentation. It is where we ask questions, where we sink below the text, or where we wait to see what might re-emerge differently.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Even as the .break .dance project is about continually reproducing a rhizomatic site of inquiry, it also helps me consider the deep extent to which hypertextual experience is as much a matter of time as it is of space and place, and that these glitched movements can thus point us toward the vast interlocking machineries that worked to establish enslavement as a foundational social and economic system of the U.S. and Caribbean. “There was a time,” Benítez-Rojo writes, “in which I believed that the code book to reading the Caribbean was the plantation.” In the following short provocations, I name some of the theoretical orientations that became the structural argument for how and why .break .dance works in ways similar to what Benítez-Rojo describes as a kind of meta-machine, braiding, braiding, braiding across the times and spaces of inquiry.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>“I think I ought to clarify at this point that when I speak of a machine I am talking about the machine of machines, the machine machine machine machine; which is to say that every machine is a conjunction of machines coupled together, and each one of these interrupts the flow of the previous one; it will be said rightly that one can picture any machine alternatively in terms of flow and interruption.”— Antonio Benítez-Rojo, “The Repeating Island”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Hurston, maybe more than anyone before or since, understood how to plumb the theoretical possibilities embedded in the daily materialities of Black diasporic expressivities, and never hesitated in thinking about how Black lives cross time, space, and medium. Dead serious with tongue in cheek, Hurston’s “Characteristics of Negro Expression,” for instance, demonstrates what it means to hold and experience all the divergent parts of blackness within a single frame, and the kinds of spiritual, aesthetic, or conceptual magic such acts of holding make possible. In looking for productive and unbroken languages that can help me think about fragmentation, I have turned to Hurstons’ description of asymmetry in Black art:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“The presence of rhythm and lack of symmetry are paradoxical, but there they are. Both are present to a marked degree. There is always rhythm, but it is the rhythm of segments. Each unit has a rhythm of its own, but when the whole is assembled it is lacking in symmetry. But easily workable to a Negro who is accustomed to the break in going from one part to another, so that he adjusts himself to the new tempo.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“The Caribbean machine, on the other hand, is flow and interruption at once; it is an absolute machine, a meta-machine, which cannot be diagrammed and whose user’s manual may be found scattered among its own network of codes… In any event, the notion of polyrhythm (rhythms cut through by other rhythms which are cut by still other rhythms)— if it takes us to the point at which the central rhythm is displaced by other rhythms in such a way as to make it fix a center no longer, then to transcend into a state of flux— may fairly define the type of performance that characterizes the Caribbean cultural machine.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:But in remixing Deleuze and Guattari, Benítez-Rojo is able to identify how pockets of resistance are seeded and accessed by the enslaved and their descendants. Here, Benítez-Rojo’s invocation of codes and coding works on several registers, which offers some insight into polyrhythm as inseparable from the social, political, and economic machineries that have historically attempted to reduce the people of the Caribbean into machines (which is to say that the presence of Africa descended people in the Caribbean is of course the absolute sign of the machineries’ high and efficient functioning). We use the word code as a catch-all for the instructions we use in order to program machines to behave, language in its barest sense, rules and structures. Encoding is the act of making data readable in the terms set forth by that code structure. We use the term “codeswitch” to talk about what it means to move between different or competing structures, encoding our language and comportment to become readable by a given machine. We also use “code” to denote practices wherein the substitution or compression of terms can be used to hide information. In Benítez-Rojo’s example, an individual’s infinite capacity to codeswitch, to move across rhythms, also reduces the power of encoding itself. The transcendence of which Benítez-Rojo speaks, flux, thus emerges as a state of constant change. In computing terms, it is unclear whether this flux is the antithesis or apotheosis of code. Indeed insofar as .break and .dance are organizing classes of Black experience, breakdancing is actually something else, machinic movement that is also something more, the body that astonishes by moving into a heretofore unimaginable state. The flux and the glitch.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:In “Sample | Signal | Strobe,” for instance, I look at how coding and compression make it possible for people under surveillance to communicate in the open, knowing that the people around them do not know how to read the right signs, cannot sense the code nor its deployment. The polyrhythmic is also ruled by code, and also instantiates the presence of encoding: if you know to know, a tresillo tells your body to do something differently, that you have found your people, that you are in a kind of space, that you are in a pocket.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Polyrhythm is glitching named as a function of time, the layering of asynchronic parts to elicit a new wholeness. Asymmetry names the glitch as a function of flow— Hurston describes asymmetric movement as the embodiment of interruption in the service of larger, meta, continuity. Brought together, we come to what Kwame Dawes describes as “stop time,” which is the rhizomatic cultural precipitate of “African-based syncopations in music.” Stop time, as Kwame Dawes describes it, is that which “tend to seduce us and enliven us with the illusion and reality of how rhythm can be manipulated.” The act of manipulation, again, for instance, the three in the two, opens whole worlds of possibility. In .break .dance, I use a figure of a tendwa map to denote the kinds of passages across time and space made available by cultural engagements that let us tap into this power and possibility: the tresillo, the pop and lock, the ringshout. The tendwa is not a map to a lost home; this is not a story about nostalgic return. But “stop time” is mandate, invocation, and description.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Stop Time, like the seeming off-kilter of reggae’s rhythm, for instance, or the irresistible ‘pockets’ in dancehall rhythms and the clave patterns of the rumba, is often the basis of the swoop and sway of the dances that it creates. I have been fascinated by the way in which stop time is a beautiful and persistent piece of luggage Africans have carried with us even without knowing it is there, and in the poem the church becomes the place where it finds sacred power—a metaphysical moment of helplessness that relies on faith—the gap, the absence, the separation—before the bridge of faith that spans the gap and brings us safely home.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>“Your ancestors’ homes died in the water, as the familiar dirt and mountains and trees became memory. As much as they might have denied it, their homes were elsewhere, along with their lives and their lineages. Which we draw now, with pen and paper and no ink. Seeing, we use our hands to trace the topography of our own etchings to imagine. But even our imaginations cannot surrender the past and give us our freedom.”</div>
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>OKO EBOMBO, "19 - IRO”  [excerpt]</div>
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>.break .dance emerged out of two different attempts to decrypt a feeling. Perhaps due to their nascent and fragmented states, the two inquiries soon began to intertwine. The first came out of some writing for the 2016 CENHS conference at Rice, as I played around with the lyrics of Bob Marley’s 1979 “Redemption Song.” I was thinking about hybrid time in a project I have been framing as Black Haunts in the Anthropocene, and kept hearing Marley’s “none of them can stop the time,” which for me elicited a sense of power emanating from outside enslavement and its vicissitudes, and resonated with a kind of ecological millenarism common to Black popular music in the Americas. In the course of that research I came across Kwame Dawes 2012 poem, “Stop Time,” which brought me back to previous thinking to Fred Moten’s In the Break.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:This rhizomatic action is equally evident in Dawes and Marley, as both writers cast nets to either side, their work echoing pieces of other things— Marley for instance riffing on Marcus Garvey’s “The Work That Has Been Done,” and Dawes drawing from Hebrews 11:1, perhaps via James Baldwin, “the evidence of things not seen.” In both cases, something nagged at me about each, but meaning was elusive. This is something more than simply recalling references; rather it is more like a kind of haunted citation that stops itself short of recitation. I, in turn, found myself haunted by these haunted texts. What does thinking about such movement make possible, and how does one think about it? In Haunting and Displacement, I explored phenomenologies of haunting across multiple valences. With projects like .break .dance, I am interested in methods of inquiry informed by a kind of critical hauntology.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:I returned to critical hauntology in trying to understand what I experienced as a series of uncanny movements in Melina Matsoukas’ video for Beyoncé’s 2016 single, “Formation,” a kind of strangeness that stayed with me. I first turned to constructing a visual inquiry, isolating the moments that stayed with me. There is of course much to say about “Formation,” and about the Lemonade visual album as well, but my purpose in invoking Lemonade in .break .dance is as an illustration of a mode of thinking. This is not at all to suggest that Lemonade does not deserve critical attention, but instead to highlight a sense of the things that work on us as scholars, which is a bit different than only thinking about texts as texts that we work over.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:This is what I saw in “Formation” that led me to this larger engagement with matters of machinery and code in Black diasporic life:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:The “Formation” video includes a series of images of Beyoncé: black dress, bolero hat, silver jeweler. The bolero standing on the porch of what looks to be a plantation manor and her manner of dress, as I describe it in .break .dance, bespeaks power. She is dressed like someone who owns. Her dance generates a sense of the uncanny, of discomfort. This is a house, but it is not a home. Mining this vein, .break .dance continues:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“When the bolero figure first appears in “Formation,” the men are still like statues as she jerks her head up and down in what can only be described as hyper-responsiveness of a marionette, the effect heightened because the figure’s eyes are never exposed, magic or trance. The stillness of her body matches that of her retinue, but the head flies up and down, paced a sliver ahead of the song’s beat, marking yet somehow also missing the song’s time. Throughout the song this ever so slightly off beat movement continues with these scenes, and it is particularly notable because so much of the video's choreography is danced expressively on the song’s notes, which is to say that the timing is clearly and intentionally impeccable. Much as the scenes of Beyoncé wearing denim and dancing on the street are made to ghost like old VHS recordings, the jerking head’s movement ghosts the beat. Indeed, much as the video version of the song reboots itself every time it samples Messy Mya or Big Freedia’s voice, Matsoukas introduces multiple instances of glitched representation, interrupting the smooth continuity of pop performance with an intimation of technological failure shifts, out which emerge increasingly resonant possibilities.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:The bolero figure’s dance, like a pop and lock that never transmits its signal to its next component, to another bodily movement, is discomfiting in its incompletion. Quite different from what I elsewhere discuss as Zora Neale Hurston’s description of asymmetrical beats and movements that generate a thirdspace of relation, an embodied machinery that produces spatial and temporal transcendence through contradistinction. The bolero figure’s movement ghosts the tresillo inflected asymmetry of Black performance in the Americas, but stops short. This stop marks the place of the uncanny, which in this context resonates with Buse and Stott’s articulation, following Freud, of uncanniness as a name for how “The familiar and secure is always haunted by the strange and unfamiliar, while the unfamiliar often has a troubling familiarity about it” and that “The experience of the Uncanny might be summed up as that moment when the seemingly natural reveals itself to be cultural after all.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:If we are following the thematic of “slavery in the machine,” then the bolero figure’s glitched movement, its incomplete pop, this stop that is not a lock, reveals a gap. Live action is revealed as animation. Moving in an off time, something else emerges, the underside of “I just might be a Black Bill Gates in the making,” the other side of the game, the other side of being she who owns. 
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Now armed with a theory of animation— animation is the term I needed and had not accessed. It gets me from conceptualizing the machined body instantiated under slavery (and as I explore in another pocket, Without Innovation: Black Lifeworlds and the Internet of Things), and points me towards theories of flow and interruption in Caribbean philosophy, which I can now bring back to other examples of Dawes’ stop time that I have already assembled in similarly nascent ways, namely the filming of Baby Suggs’ ringshout in Jonathan Demme’s film version of Toni Morrison’s Beloved, and Hiro Murai’s video for Flying Lotus and Kendrick Lamar’s “Never Catch Me.” I expand the pocket.</div>
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Viewed from the vantage point of the partial, the old idea that books are written in solitude by great authors is dislodged and gives way to a new understanding of creative production as a reflexive process that takes place at the thresholds between readers, writers, texts, and technologies.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Some of this is a matter of interface and navigation, as Trettien and McDonald highlight, the form of the book itself invites an imagination of control and coherence. But .break .dance is a kind of tool that I have elsewhere described as a pocket, and it is the fifth I have opened and entered over the last few years. I chose the term “pocket” to describe my sense of a kind of digital writing that foregrounds experiences of inquiry. A pocket is what happens between a hunch and the later connection of that feeling to a larger set of research questions. This feeling of suspension is critical to my work, but I have always struggled to articulate this intellectual habit as a method. But by focusing on process I became better able to think more self-consciously and honestly about the why of what I am thinking.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:A pocket is a place; it is also a position. Pockets are also places for experimentation in form and content. It is also a kind of space, a thing behind a thing, the thing you hold on to, just in case. It is the non-space between thought and its elaboration or instrumentation, a tiny universe of intellectual possibility. In “Sample | Signal | Strobe,” I am working through some of the stakes of resetting the timeline for what we characterize as the emergence of digital technologies, an approach that is grounded in an anarchaeological approach to thinking about digital social media. In exemplifying some of the potential value in the use of research pockets as a kind of ephemeral staking of a research process, .break .dance is about the anarchival. Senselab offers a useful description of what such things might look like:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“The question is how what moves an event into taking form can be archived, as opposed to documenting the content of the event. Can traces of the event’s liveness be captured, in a way that might set the stage for a next event to occur in its wake? The anarchive would then be a kind of process seed bank for the dissemination of forces of emergent taking form.” (Senselab)
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>A section titled “Resurrection” comprises one of the longest interludes during the Lemonade visual album, appearing between the set-piece performances of the songs “Sandcastles” and “Freedom.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:This resonance is amplified as the scene segues immediately into images of cast members holding pictures of loved ones killed by racial violence. Though there is no commentary offered, the cast members’ appearances are interspersed with those of Black women whose children, namely Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner, had been recently killed in acts of police violence. Each child’s photo is held by a mother, respectively Sybrina Fulton, Lesley McSpadden, and Gwen Carr, women who would later remain recognizable throughout #BlackLivesMatter as “Mothers of the Movement.” Their inclusion in the space of the text radically shifts Lemonade’s emphasis from matters of infidelity, power, trust, and recuperation to larger questions of identity, civic membership, and mourning, now further refracted as facets of Black women’s lives. Filmed just a few months after the women’s losses, having them appear together in the same span of film, and with each woman staged similarly in her grief, strengthens the sense of each woman’s loss as part of a larger phenomenon. Each loss is scattered temporally and geographically, yet each is also historically and socially linked, an example of Black diasporic digitality (which I discuss at length in “Sample | Signal | Strobe”).
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:This sense of moving across time and space is also heightened by the alternating uses of color and black and white photography, and also because the different women in the interlude are filmed using different aspect ratios which, generates a sense of device difference that emphasizes spatial and temporal difference, even as the overlaying of James Blake’s song “Forward” and the timing of the camera’s zoom into each woman’s photo over the entire segment heightens continuity. Indeed, this comes to a head in McSpadden’s moment, as her tears and the subtle shaking of her head, a soft “no,” remind us of her fresh pain and also names the gift of her allowing an eminently private loss to continually resonate as a public one, a kind of civic intimacy.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>“Sandcastles,” the song immediately preceding this section of Lemonade, is a song about lost dreams and marital realities. It is a quiet and soft song, and its visual performance in Lemonade is intensely intimate, mainly alternating between medium shots of the protagonist performing in private, which heightens a sense of her solitude and contemplation, and intense close-up shots of her with the partner with whom she seeks reconciliation. Paired with the piano driven melody of the song, the close-ups risk seeming invasive, visual cognates to the protagonist’s cracking voice.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:This alternation in shot distance moves with a rhythm similar to the camera’s zooming and distancing later during “Resurrection.” Taken together, the “Sandcastles” performance and the “Resurrection” segment enable Lemonade to evince a straight line from the personal to the political. In allowing audiences to share in quiet aftermaths of women’s loss, the sequence pushes us into a new sense of time and space, a sense of having been offered a glimpse into a pocket of Black female experience that carries implications for the very possibility of sustaining thriving lifeworlds in the Americas. Aftermath is the terrain, what grows after the reaping.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>In Lemonade it is the appearance of a Mardi Gras Indian, Queen Ya Ya of the Washitaw Nation, who is given the task of clearing the space that enables a transition from “Resurrection” to the next segment, “Hope.” The rattle of her tamborine clears the space, smudging boundaries between what has come before and that which might hope to arrive after.The queen approaches the camera to exit the room, crossing the viewer’s perspectival plane as the scene morphs into a second room. The editing here is not seamless, and the transition between rooms visually shifts just a bit. A twinge of the uncanny, a technical glitch as her entrance into the second room is an almost repetition of her first arrival. The protagonist and dancers from a performance earlier in Lemonade that also uses glitched performance, “Sorry,” reappear in silence as a voiceover whispers “magic.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>At the end of “Resurrection,” for instance, we follow the Beyoncé protagonist as she steps through a door, presumably the door to the fortress where she first appeared in the segment; the frame rate slows, elongating each of her steps. This movement splices into a shot of the Black women whom we encounter throughout Lemonade, themselves stepping into an outbuilding kitchen, the camera’s eye vertically matching their angle of approach to Beyonce’s. The women are quiet and working. Perhaps it is the appearance of the segment title, “Hope,” or the visual abundance of foods with which they work. But their work feels focused and joyful, a sense of presence and competence that stands, and perhaps has always stood, in opposition to historical circumstance: the plantation kitchen is an absolute representation of Black women’s subjugation. At the same time, it also a place that, for fleeting moments, offers a sense of domain, a space of control despite the forces that mandate their presence and action in the space. Their food and its origins, cabbages from Europe, apples from Asia, corn, yuca, cassava, and squash from the Americas, and watermelon from Africa, reflects the broadening of knowledges that have also come to characterize that domain. Much as Beyonce’s character is more symbol than agent in this segment, these are not women; these are a feeling about being women.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>The landscape and built structures across the “Resurrection” segment are from the visual montage at Lemonade’s opening, and similarly highlights Black femme portraiture as emerging from, or perhaps in spite of the pain and secret sedimented in the U.S. Southern landscape. Both the “Resurrection” and “Hope” segments are also paired with recitations of Warshan Shire’s poetry, thematically redolent in its work to link Black women’s experiences of romantic loss to larger conceptual frameworks premised on the ubiquity of social and civic loss— slavery and the precipitates of violence over time.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>The segment’s denouement introduces an infant alone on a bed, as a muted instrumental from “Freedom” plays. The instrumental fades again as the scene soon transitions. Every child might evince a sense of hope, but Black children in the Americas must also instill a sense of fear and foreboding, which is here amplified by the segment’s inclusion of the mothers of the movement. Because the song’s arrival is soon interrupted, it is experienced as intimation of something else. In this way freedom is literally something glimpsed from the future, which further heightens the intense outpouring of emotion that can be released when the song reappears a few minutes later in Lemonade. If in the larger .break .dance project I am interested in working with Hurston’s notion of asymmetrical performance and Dawes’ sense of “Stop Time,” it also worth noting here a different kind of temporal effect that must be survived, and that precipitates the cultural responses identified by Dawes and Hurston— split time. I identify such an experience as one of the breadcrumbs followed in .break .dance, as the broken break dance of the porch figure in black during “Formation,” begins to mimic the movements of the dancers in denim, whom are staged as clearly operating in a different time and place.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>Much as the landscape and built structures across the “Resurrection” segment are from the visual montage at Lemonade’s opening, and similarly highlights Black femme portraiture as emerging from, or perhaps in spite of the pain and secret sedimented in the U.S. Southern landscape.

_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:A sense of Black women’s historical oscillation between trauma and recovery carries into the next segment, “Hope,” which overlays a recitation of Warsan Shire’s poem “Nail Technician as Palm Reader” as the viewer is returned to the same fortress setting that opened the previous segment. The sky darkens thunder and lightning and we see Beyoncé traversing the space and up the stairs this resonating with moving up the stairs makes me think of Haile Gerima, the idea of exiting out of the slave castle through “the door of no hope.” But whereas Gerima’s protagonist Mona, first exits the castle and into American enslavement, this woman exits the cancels into freedom.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>Whenever I am building a digital project I hear Édouard Glissant’s gentle ambivalence about computing, as it stands in relation to other kinds of expressive investigation. The computer, he writes, “seems to be the privileged instrument of someone wanting to ‘follow’ any Whole whose variants multiply vertiginously. It is useful for suggesting what is stable within the unstable. Therefore, though it does not create poetry, it can ‘show the way’ to a poetics.” But still.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>One might also think here of Emily Legg’s thinking, which points us toward understanding the deep systems transformations necessary to decolonizing digital spaces. In, “Networked Knowledge,” building on the work of scholars of indigenous memory and history such as Kimberly Roppolo and Chris Teuton, Legg reminds us to think in explicitly digital materialist ways about the kairotic possibilities of
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“storytelling as knowledge-making and a way of knowing is not placed within one individual who passes the knowledge down to others. Instead, it is knowledge that exists in a networked state with the role of the community as knowledge producers.” </div>
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>Whenever I am building a digital project I hear Audre Lorde— “The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house,” and I think: and still I want to build houses. It is significant that, when she puts forth her rightfully famous formulation, Lorde is specifically speaking about the painful and potentially self-effacing calculations required to align non-white women’s interests with mainstream and academic feminism, a conversation that is still very much alive today. Still.
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>In creating and cultivating the .break .dance digital project, I am thinking about how digital inquiries potentiate forms that literally and figuratively enhance, even sometimes transform, the kinds of social, creative, and political networks out of which we have ourselves emerged.I am also thinking about how, as Wendy Chun and others have shown, a computer’s backend stability, the computational processes that enable a platform’s ordering of spatial and temporal experience as a recognizably useful or generically pleasurable digital experience, also come at a cost. In “Sample | Signal | Strobe,” I take up the question of how, in the ticking away of the timeline and in the displacement of user input, digital social media acts are simultaneously obscured and data-archivable, ethereal and earthly undersea cables, black boxes, algorithmic displacement. Thrumming below this characterization is Tara McPherson’s assessment of how North American regimes of race and gender have historically moved in tandem with key understandings of the purpose and execution of computer coding. “Both exist as operating systems of a sort, and we might understand them to be mutually reinforcing” (McPherson, 23). She continues:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Certain modes of racial visibility and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing data: if digital computing underwrites today’s information economy and is the central technology of post-World War II America, these technologized ways of seeing/knowing took shape in a world also struggling with shifting knowledges about and representations of race” (McPherson, 24).
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“All machines have their master-codes, and the codebook to the cultural machine of the Peoples of the Sea is made up of a net-work of sub-codes holding together cosmogonies, mythic bestiaries, remote pharmocopoeias, oracles, profound ceremonies, and the mysteries and alchemies of humanity… The keys to this vast hermeneutical system give us an ‘other’ wisdom that runs next to and erodes the mortar of post-industrial society.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:In her sprawling and masterful 1991 novel Almanac of the Dead, Leslie Marmo Silko’ uses the experiences of Clinton, an itinerant African-American Vietnam War veteran, to highlight a sense of shared spiritual dimensionality across Black and Indigenous communities in the Americas. In Almanac he turns to oral histories and also his college courses in Black Studies to build conceptualize and popularize a paradigm for Black survivance (drawing again on Vizenor’s term), rather than merely relying on the habits of survival that have come to mark his own life. In Clinton’s cosmology, in which he explicitly describes the Americas as a space in which “great American and great African tribal cultures had come together to create a powerful consciousness within all people”— one can understand Legba, Gede de Rouge, Ogun, the Maize Mother, Damballa, loas, Quetzacoatl, as nodes in a web, access granted through various media of ritual and practice:
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“Clinton wanted black people to know all their history; he wanted them to know all that had gone on before in Africa; how great and powerful gods had traveled from Africa with the people. He wanted black Americans to know how deeply African blood had watered the soil of the Americas for five hundred years. But there had been an older and deeper connection between Africa and the Americas, in the realm of the spirits. Yet for a while, it must have seemed to the Africans who had survived ocean crossings that their gods had indeed forsaken them.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>One might also think here of Katherine McKittrick’s rationale for navigating between materialist and figurative understandings of Black diasporic spatial experiences. In articulating what is at stake in conceptually navigating between the often simultaneously geographic and ungeographic realities of diasporic experiences, McKittrick highlights how “overlaps between materiality and language are long-standing in the diaspora.” Further, because language and other media are so often called upon to do the work of establishing or transcending space, working to
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:“forge a conceptual connection between material or concrete spaces, language, and subjectivity, openings are made possible for envisioning an interpretive alterable world, rather than a transparent and knowable world.” </div>
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>As a format that focuses on enabling and archiving proto-inquiry, the thinking that gets me to the thought, .break .dance is a homebrewed non-platform that helps me think differently about showing rather than telling, to show how it feels to “multiply vertiginously,” to explore the poetics of breaking and dancing, to mine for the poetics of response and resistance instantiated by the Atlantic slave trade, and to be inspired by what in “The Repeating Island” Benítez-Rojo describes as “the Caribbean machine, whose flux, whose noise, whose presence, covers the map of world history’s contingencies, through the great changes in economic discourse to the vast collisions of races and cultures.” Behind Benítez-Rojo’s earliest descriptions of the Caribbean as a vast machinery constructed of interlocking machines constructed in imperialism and consolidated by the Atlantic slave trade, I still heard Lorde, who offers a nascent blueprint for how to control this machinery, how to transform the New World’s difference engine into an analytic one:“Within the interdependence of mutual (nondominant) differences lies that security which enables us to descend into the chaos of knowledge and return with true visions of our future, along with the concomitant power to effect those changes which can bring that future into being. Difference is that raw and powerful connection from which our personal power is forged.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:Networks such as those described by Emily Legg draw power and sustenance from traditions of shape changers and fluid structures that are not merely metaphors for margins or even sites of experimentation, per se. In thinking about this it is also useful here to turn again to “The Repeating Island,” and Antonio Benítez-Rojo’s rendition of the geological facticity of the Caribbean archipelago— the ancient land bridge in pieces, pieces that become islands, each island seeding its own flourishing. In committing to such a turn, we are able to further explore the possibilities reminded to us in Katherine McKittrick’s rendition of the world as continually available to renewed interpretation, the kinds of possibility encapsulated in the dialectic between language and the physical world, the heft of the geographic and the psychic trails forged in historical experiences of the ungeographic. 
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>I am having after-work drinks with my friend and colleague Lisa Brooks, the evening is warm and we are talking about our various paths to our various kinds of digital and decolonial work. We know that we are having this conversation from a privileged position, tenured at a resourced institution. Still we expand and contract with feeling, as constellations of our own and other’s academic pasts brighten and fade over our conversation: all the times our work was too literary for studies departments, but too “cultural studies” for literature. All the ways, even today, we risk being excluded from the center of literature departments’ self imaginations, because we are too interdisciplinary or too ethnic studies or too experimental or, now, “too digital.”</div>
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>And maybe it is true that scholars of our generation will always be too x. We are well predecessed in our scholarly lineages, but also institutionally unprecedented. She and I are, respectively, .1 and 1.6% of our profession. Which is to say that even as we have become able to fight power with power, even just being here— where we are, as we are— will always remain a story about the deep traumas of the Americas set against our own experiences of survivance and diasporic dexterity. We are sitting on the patio of the Lord Jeffrey Inn, a restaurant owned by the college for which we work, and named for a British general whose blueprints for indigenous genocide sealed his fame as a great man of colonial American history. From Newfoundland to Colorado, North America is littered with the name “Amherst,” vague fealty, the bankruptcy of conquest’s spatial imagination, rubble out of which we nonetheless continually build futures.But today we are also happy together, sipping the week’s tiredness from our bones. As Gerald Vizenor reminds us, Survivance is more than mere survival. In this case we know that we are having this conversation from a genuinely privileged position, tenured at a resourced institution, structurally bettered enabled now to ease others’ paths. But there is always an edge, and it is sharp. For we know that we are having this conversation from a genuinely tesseracted position. I am a stolen person sitting with my friend on land that was stolen from her. Where are you sitting? (via Native Land Digital)
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>From this perspective, we have always already been thinking about the digital. Much as Ntozake Shange would create the term “choreopoem” to describe her 1975 for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf, artists constantly create new representational forms that better express the social, cultural, and historical paradigms out which their work arises. Across .break .dance I take, as objects of contemplation, excerpts from Beyoncé’s visual album Lemonade. Even as it tells a story, moving across the stages of a woman’s reckoning with infidelity, in its orchestration of multiple voices, layered sites of authorship, and parlaying poetry and dance to make implicit and explicit claims grounded in the most private sites of racial and sexual injustice, Lemonade shares many similarities with the formal innovation of Shange’s choreopoem. As collages, both texts show their seams, and in so doing produce intersubjective spaces of encounter between reader, idea, and text. Trettien and McDonald identify the power of forms that rely on gaps and fragmentation to invite readers to generate meaning in the spaces between and around things. “Some strange alchemy occurs in the moment a sentence becomes a fragment—" they write, "it simultaneously gains both heft and dexterity. No matter which sentence you select, it will speak to you in some oblique way, to your current project or your current romance.”
_issue03/break-dance-process/index.html:		<div>"Letter-by-letter, syllable-by-syllable, word- by-word, image-by-image, a new language, embryonic and inchoate, is defacing the value accumulated in the creaky edifice that is crumbling around us even as it continues to churn out and police its signifiers. The art of spatial literacy— the ability to read one's environs in order to decode and disrupt the center of discourse—is the lingua franca of blackness. The disintegration of language, the transcendence of its limitations and the acknowledgement of its betrayals, has led to a fluency with the “multiplication of modes of writing”  that fill this littered, lettered landscape."

Written accounts, plantation ledgers, slave narratives, oral traditions, music, folklore, and more are standard “go-to” resources for uncovering the subtle contours of slave life in the past. In the past few decades, archaeological evidence has increasingly entered the conversation, providing a valuable new archive for studying the materiality of slavery in the past. This evidence sometimes corroborates, often counters, and always agitates dominant narratives about slave societies in the New World, and the archaeological study of slavery has expanded significantly since the first excavations were undertaken in slave quarters decades ago.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:Since 2000, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, Jillian Galle and Fraser Neiman of the Monticello Department of Archaeology have led an initiative to rectify this issue. Their efforts have resulted in the [Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery](https://www.daacs.org/), a relational PostgreSQL online database designed to synthesize available archaeological datasets from the Southeast and the Caribbean and to make these data accessible to the public. As the site creators note, the primary goal of DAACS is “to foster inter-site, comparative archaeological research that will advance our historical understanding of the slavery-based societies that evolved in the Atlantic World during the early-modern era.”[^3] DAACS is becoming increasingly visible in the archaeological community, driving change in the way archaeologists think about teaching and researching slavery in the New World.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:The DAACS site is organized hierarchically. The [home page](https://www.daacs.org/) provides a visually attractive gateway to the site, with a running list of tabs placed along the top, each linking to more specific lines of inquiry. Additionally, a number of prominently displayed features on the home page provide direct links to information of interest to a general audience. One takes you to the “[About DAACS](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035144/https://www.daacs.org/aboutdaacs/)” page, which provides useful contextual information about the history and goals of the project as well as participants and institutional partners. Another directs the visitor to the “[Galleries](https://www.daacs.org/research/galleries/)” page (under “Research”), which includes links to a highlights of artifact assemblages from a subset of sites included in the archive. For the novice in archaeology, these are excellent starting points. Here one can find an overview of DAACS history and goals and gain an appreciation for the range of artifacts recovered from plantation sites, before digging deeper into the database.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:If your interests rest primarily in gaining a broad, qualitative appreciation for specific sites, the “[Archaeological Sites](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035155/https://www.daacs.org/archaeological-sites-map/)” tab on the home page will take you to a comprehensive list of excavations included in DAACS. Clicking on any particular excavation, you will be taken to an archaeological map of the site, with links to general information about excavation history and methods, lists of archaeological features, and a discussion of the chronology of features, as well as a comprehensive set of photographs and bibliographic references. This information will be particularly helpful for gaining a general knowledge of a site, locating references to the archaeological contexts, or just getting a sense of the features one might use for further comparative analysis.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:If you are interested in digging much deeper into the data, the “[Query the Database](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035202/https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/)” tab on the home page will take you to a set of “queries” that allow you to extract specific information about one site, or a group of sites, located in DAACS. A [context query](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/context-queries/) will produce information on all of the archaeological contexts and features excavated in the sites selected. In contrast, an [artifact query](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/artifact-queries/) will yield finds lists for the site(s) selected, allowing you to quantify patterns within a site or compare the relative frequencies of different kinds of artifacts between sites. Such queries, for example, allow you to determine whether enslaved Africans at one site consumed wild foods or utilized locally produced cooking pots to a greater degree than those at another, questions with important implications for our comparative understanding of the economy and culture of slave sites. Furthermore, other queries can be run to locate primary documents about sites, explore site chronology, or retrieve artifact images.
_issue02/monroe-review.md:A number of additional features render DAACS an invaluable resource for both research and teaching. First, under the “[About the Database](http://web.archive.org/web/20170904035207/https://www.daacs.org/about-the-database/)” tab are located a series of manuals and guides for cataloguing artifacts, information on how the database was structured, and instructions on interpreting and using DAACS data. Second, under the “[Research](https://www.daacs.org/research/)” tab, the creators have provided a comprehensive bibliography of conference presentations, publications, and theses that have used DAACS data, as well as a bibliography of source material for the sites presented. Third, the “[Syllabi and Workshops Handouts](https://www.daacs.org/research/workshops/)” page (also under the “Research” tab) contains useful lists of datasets, syllabi, and teaching modules provided by teaching professionals at DAACS and from universities across the country. These are mostly geared toward a university-level audience with some basic skills in quantitative analysis; however, they could be easily modified to suit a more general audience.

_issue02/introduction.md:Our second section, "Digital Projects," features the public peer review of the digital cartography site *Ramble Bahamas: A Project by “From Dat Time."* Presented with feedback on both the form and content of their platform, site authors Jessica Dawson and Tracey Thompson responded generously and thoroughly to the *sx archipelagos* reviewer's queries and critiques, clarifying and streamlining elements of their site and providing an insightful written account of the site's logic and intentions. The second essay in this section, Angela Sutton's "The Digital Overhaul of the Archive of Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies (ESSSS)," breaks new ground for us. With this submission we opened up the "Digital Projects" section to the *inventio* genre—often called "project narratives" or "progress narratives"—familiar to digital humanities audiences.
